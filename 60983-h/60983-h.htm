<p>“I’ve never had any luck,” said Hugh Sinclair,
lifting a stein of beer and emptying it in one
steady draught.</p>

<p>The fashionably dressed man, with graying
hair on his temples who sat opposite him at the
table, left his own foaming mug untouched as
he watched the handsome, rough-looking boy
of twenty-four with a half smile.</p>

<p>“Nor my father before me,” added Hugh, as
he set down the empty stein. “No silver spoons
in the mouths of our family when they are
born.”</p>

<p>“Your father was a pretty fine man,” remarked
the other.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I suppose so,” said the boy carelessly.
“I remember, Mr. Ogden, that you and
he were a sort of pals. I suppose it was on his
account that you looked me up to-day. I’m
sorry I haven’t any better hospitality to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
you than a near-beer joint. These hot dogs
aren’t so bad, though. Try ’em.”</p>

<p>The young fellow drove his fork into the food
on his plate and his companion followed his
example, while a brazen automatic piano in the
corner crashed out “The Virginia Blues.”</p>

<p>John Ogden began to eat. “I love that clever
human who cursed the man that put the din
into dinner, and took the rest out of restaurant,”
he said.</p>

<p>“M’h’m,” agreed Hugh with his mouth full.</p>

<p>“Who are left in your family?” asked Ogden.
“The last time I saw you was twelve years ago,
and do you know why I remember the date?”</p>

<p>Hugh looked up. “Can’t imagine. Something
about father, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, about your sister Carol.”</p>

<p>“Good old Carol?” said the boy with surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. How much more time have you
before you must go back to the store?”</p>

<p>Hugh looked at his wrist watch. Its dilapidated
leather bracelet matched the carelessness
of its owner’s general appearance. “Half an
hour.”</p>

<p>“Then let us eat quickly and get to some
quiet spot.”</p>

<p>They found it in a hotel lobby on the way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Hugh’s place of business, and in transit John
Ogden took further mental note of his companion’s
shabbiness. Not only were his clothes
in need of brushing, but he had not shaved
to-day; his shoes were dusty and by industry
the boy finished several cigarettes before, in the
hotel lobby, they found a couple of neighboring
chairs, and he lighted another.</p>

<p>“Hard luck to tote you around this way, Mr.
Ogden, but all I’ve got is a hall bedroom in a
hash house.”</p>

<p>“You talk a lot about luck, don’t you?”
remarked the older man. “You don’t look as if
you had ever gone after it very hard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” responded Hugh; “I’ve batted
around considerable after jobs.”</p>

<p>“You don’t keep them very long, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, and the devil can take them for all me.
I’ve never had anything worth keeping since I
got back from France. I care for nobody and
nobody cares for me. That’s about the size of
it, and most of the other fellows are the same
way. My friends are all Bolshevists.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” said the older man, regarding
the frank young ne’er-do-well with some
disgust, “that isn’t worthy of your father’s
son.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but what do you care?” turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
upon his well-dressed, well-groomed companion;
nettled by the shade of contempt in his
tone. “My father’s dead and that’s the end of
him.”</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you why I care,” said
Ogden, meeting the inimical look in the exceedingly
handsome blue eyes bent upon him. He
paused a minute, then added, “I am glad I
stopped over and hunted you up. You remind
me of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Hugh listlessly, “Carol.
You said something about Carol.”</p>

<p>“I did,” returned the other quietly. “Twelve
years ago to-day I asked her to be my wife.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em>—Carol?” The boy’s voice was so
incredulous that Ogden smiled.</p>

<p>“Yes; I wasn’t always forty-two, you know.
I was thirty then, and she was eighteen.”</p>

<p>“That was the reason you hung around
father, then?”</p>

<p>“One of the reasons, yes,” said Ogden slowly.
“She was a sober little head for eighteen, and it
was largely because for years she had had to be
a mother to her little brother.”</p>

<p>The tone and manner in which this was said
caused Hugh to remove his cigarette for a
thoughtful moment. “Good old Carol,” he
said; then, restoring the cigarette, he added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
“I wish to thunder she had married you. That
guy Morrison carried her off to Colorado. She
hated to leave me like the devil. She wrote me
every day while I was over there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t light another cigarette, Hugh,” exclaimed
the other in irrepressible impatience.
“Don’t you know you never will hold a position
if you’re one of these coffin-tack slaves?”</p>

<p>Hugh flared up. The flare showed in his
beautiful eyes and darkened them to violet.
Who was this glass of fashion to dictate to a
decent Bolshevist like himself!</p>

<p>“And don’t I tell you I don’t give a damn
how many dinky positions I lose?” he retorted.</p>

<p>Ogden put a soothing hand on the boy’s big
arm and was nervously shaken off. “I’m sorry,
old man. Don’t take it that way. Of course
you’re free, white, and twenty-one; but I can’t
help taking an interest in you.”</p>

<p>“Better cut it. I thank you, of course, for
looking me up”—Hugh rose—“but I’ve got
to trot along now. Good luck to you.”</p>

<p>John Ogden rose, too. “It won’t be good
luck for me unless I see you again. I’m staying
at this hotel. Come to dinner with me to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Thank you just the same, but I’ve
no togs decent to dine in a place like this.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The boy was somewhat touched by the older
man’s invitation and manner, and he smiled
grudgingly, revealing perfect teeth and more
than ever causing Ogden a twinge of memory.
“I can dress for a dinner of Reds in some
cellar. That’s my size.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Hugh. Listen. This is my
anniversary. I never could love another girl
after Carol. I’ve gone lonely for twelve years
for her sake. If she could have felt differently
I should have been your big brother all this
time. Won’t you dine with me to-night? This
is always a hard day for me.”</p>

<p>Hugh looked down on his immaculate companion
curiously. How could a man, with hair
graying around the temples and growing thin
on the crown, nurse memories of love? It
seemed absurd. But the face regarding him so
steadily was a strong one. An idea suddenly
occurred to the boy.</p>

<p>“Were you in the big shindy?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What were you?”</p>

<p>“Major of infantry.”</p>

<p>“Get any bumps?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I achieved a little limp. Didn’t you
notice it?”</p>

<p>“I hated the officers,” remarked Hugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you come to-night?”</p>

<p>There was only a trifle more of hesitation
before the boy answered: “Well—I’ll come.”</p>

<p>Ogden slapped him on the back and he
moved off with long, deliberate strides. The
older man looked after him. The boy’s splendid
build and the grace with which his head was set
on those firm shoulders attracted many a glance
wherever he appeared.</p>

<p>The man sighed. He was familiar with the
type of disillusioned returned members of
the A.E.F., who went out surrounded by the
incense of hero-worship, and came back to the
shock of finding themselves negligible.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">FOR CAROL</span></h2>

<p>At the appointed hour Hugh came. He had
made the concession of blacking his shoes, and
shaving, and the unkempt hair of the noon
hour, though obviously still in need of the
barber, had been brushed until its dark auburn
waves lay thickly in place.</p>

<p>John Ogden had secured a table for two in a
retired corner and ordered a dinner, the first
couple of courses of which seemed to cheer the
gloom of his guest.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to call you Major,” said
the boy.</p>

<p>“Not if it does violence to your feelings. I
am plain John Ogden again, you know. I
would like to forget the war.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” returned Hugh, swallowing a
mighty mouthful of red snapper.</p>

<p>When the meat course was well under way,
Ogden began his investigation again.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me much about yourself,”
he said. “It seems as if you must have
relatives in town. Why should you be living in
a boarding-house? It’s too bad. I thought I
remembered connections of your father’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“There were some odd cousins of his about
when I was a kid,” said Hugh, “but they have
disappeared. I wouldn’t live with ’em on a bet,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Then there was some one else,” persisted
the host. “Your father had a very wealthy
aunt, I remember.”</p>

<p>The filet was so extremely good that under
its influence Hugh smiled at this reminiscence.
“Oh, that old dame,” he remarked. “Yes,
she’s still in the ring. You couldn’t kill her
with an axe. She must be a hundred and fifty
by this time; but she doesn’t live here, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I thought she did.”</p>

<p>“No, old Sukey lives in Farrandale”—naming
a rural city some hundred miles distant
from the metropolis.</p>

<p>John Ogden admired beauty in man, woman,
or child, and the light of contemptuous amusement
which now played over the face of his
guest so relieved its habitual sullenness that the
host allowed himself the pleasure of staring for
a silent space. He was very conscious of the
glances bent upon Hugh from other tables, but
the boy himself was entirely engrossed in the
best dinner he had enjoyed for many a moon.</p>

<p>“There was some quarrel, I remember,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Ogden; “some trouble between her and your
father.”</p>

<p>“Well, slightly,” returned Hugh. “She
didn’t have any children, so my father, being
her nephew, she set out to run him. Dad had a
pretty stiff upper lip, and she claimed he ruined
her life by disobeying her in his marriage, and
in his business, and in the place he chose to live,
and so on <i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>.”</p>

<p>“So she let him die without forgiving him.”</p>

<p>“Let him die! She’d have made him die if
she could.”</p>

<p>“And she ignores the existence of you and
Carol.”</p>

<p>“Well, rather.”</p>

<p>“It is all very vague in my remembrance
because I didn’t notice anything much but
Carol in those days. So”—the speaker paused
again—“you are very much alone in the
world, Hugh.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the boy carelessly. “What’s the
difference? I don’t want any relatives bothering.”</p>

<p>When the meat course was finished, he took
out a package of cigarettes. “Have a tack on
me?” he said, and his host accepted one, but
offered his guest a cigar which the boy refused
with a curt shake of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course, if I could have Carol, I’d like
it,” he went on. “Carol’s never a nuisance. It
would be good for me, too. I know that. If the
Volstead Act hadn’t been sneaked in on us, I
know perfectly well I wouldn’t last long. I
haven’t any way of making hootch and no
money to buy it, so I still cumber the ground.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to hear a young fellow talk like
that,” said John Ogden, and he was not so
unconscious of the servant class as to feel easy
under the waiter’s entertainment.</p>

<p>“A young fellow doesn’t like to talk that
way either,” retorted Hugh, “but what is there
in it? What’s the use of anything? Of course,
I’ve thought of the movies.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Thought of going into the movies.” Hugh
did not lower his voice, and the waiter was
indefatigable in his attentions.</p>

<p>“I’m a looker,” went on the boy impersonally,
as he attacked the salad. “Wallie Reid
and Valentino—any of those guys wouldn’t
have anything on me if I chose to go in for it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you, then?” John Ogden
thought he might as well share the waiter’s
entertainment.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s too much bother, and the director
yells at you, and they put that yellow stuff all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
over you when you know you’re yellow enough
already.”</p>

<p>The boy laughed, and sending out a cloud of
smoke from his Grecian nose again attacked his
crab-meat.</p>

<p>After they had finished the ices and while
they were drinking their coffee, Ogden succeeded
in driving off the reluctant waiter.</p>

<p>“I’m interested in that inexorable grand-aunt
of yours,” he said. “What is her name?”</p>

<p>“Susanna Frink,” returned Hugh, “affectionately
known in the bosom of the family as
‘Old Sukey the Freak.’”</p>

<p>His host sat up and leaned forward. “Not
possible! Susanna Frink your aunt?”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t my fault,” said Hugh, raising the
smooth dark eyebrows his host had been admiring.</p>

<p>“But I know her,” said Ogden. “There’s a
masterful old lady for you!”</p>

<p>“You bet your life,” agreed Hugh. “I’ve
always believed she must be a descendant of
that old galoot—I mean Canute, that commanded
the proud wave—thus far and no
farther!”</p>

<p>“Well, I never knew that Susanna Frink was
Mr. Sinclair’s aunt. He never said much about
her to me, but Carol used to laugh about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
family fortune that was so near and yet so far.
Miss Frink is a personage, Hugh. I’ve had
business dealings with her, and she prides herself
on being a lady of the old school. She told
me so herself. All alone in the world, and feels
it, I know, for all her proud front.”</p>

<p>“False front probably,” put in Hugh.</p>

<p>“Perhaps.” Ogden smiled. “Anyway, it is
dark—”</p>

<p>“What did I tell you!”</p>

<p>“And faultlessly waved, and she is straight
as an arrow and slender, and she drives about
in her victoria with the bay horses in the
fashion of fifty years ago, scorning automobiles
with her whole soul. Her bonnet ties under her
chin, and her eyeglasses are attached to a black
ribbon. She has personality plus. You ought
to meet her.”</p>

<p>“Meet her!” Hugh leaned forward with a
scowl of incredulous disgust. “Wrinkled old
harridan in a black wig! What should I want
to meet her for?”</p>

<p>Ogden studied him thoughtfully—“You
don’t resemble your father. Neither did Carol.
You must have had a beautiful mother.”</p>

<p>“We did.” Hugh felt in an inside pocket and
took out a small rubbed morocco photograph
case. Opening it, he handed it to his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Color came into the latter’s face as he looked
at it. “Carol!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No. Mother. What do you think of old
Sukey for trying to lay father off that peach?”</p>

<p>“I’d give a thousand dollars for this picture,”
said Ogden, upon which Hugh took it from him
without ceremony and returned it to his inside
pocket.</p>

<p>“It was Carol’s,” he said. “She gave it to me
to take over there. I guess it was a mascot, for
I pulled through some tight places.”</p>

<p>John Ogden continued to gaze at him for
sheer pleasure in the way his lips curved
over the faultless teeth in an occasional smile,
bringing back his romance with the gentle girl,
who liked him, but not well enough—</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hugh, rising, “I mustn’t take
any more of your time, Mr. Ogden. I had
forgotten there were dinners like that in the
world, and I thank you, I’m sure, for bothering
yourself.” He held out his hand, but his host
took him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a hurry, old man,” he said.
“The party isn’t over yet. Have you any best
girl you want to go to see?”</p>

<p>“Divil a girl. I called up one that I’d met
one evening, and asked if I could drop in, and
she said, ‘Certainly,’ and went on to ask what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
we were going to do—what were we going to
see? ‘Good-night,’ said I, and hung up with a
click. My first and last offense.”</p>

<p>John Ogden laughed. “Sit down, then, if
there is no meeting of the Reds to-night.”</p>

<p>Hugh laughed and dropped back into his
chair.</p>

<p>“I’ve had an idea,” said his friend. “You
liked the dinner. How would you like to have
one like that every night?”</p>

<p>“Foolish question number 13,” responded
Hugh.</p>

<p>“I know a way you can get it.”</p>

<p>“Well”—the boy regarded his dignified
companion curiously—“so do I; but Bolshevism
and safe-cracking aren’t the same thing.”</p>

<p>“A sufficient number of good dinners cure
Bolshevism, I’ve noticed,” said Ogden. “I
have hopes of you if you will do what I say.”</p>

<p>“Shoot,” remarked Hugh, still gazing at him
imperturbably.</p>

<p>“You have had some thought of being an
actor. I’m offering you a part.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what business you were in,
Mr. Ogden. Are you a producer?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m in the wool business, and I’ll give
you some to pull over your Aunt Susanna’s
eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled, and Hugh shook his head.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know what you are talking
about.”</p>

<p>“The question is how much stamina have
you, Hugh? Could you, for instance, stop your
cigarettes? I believe that is the eighth you’re on
now.”</p>

<p>“I can do anything I want to, of course,”
said the young fellow coolly, “but I don’t believe
you can make me want to do that.”</p>

<p>“Are you so in love with your present way of
living?” asked Ogden dryly. “Your hall bedroom
wouldn’t seem to indicate a very valuable
business position.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any position. I’ve got a job,
packing boxes in the basement of a department
store.”</p>

<p>“She owns the biggest department store in
Farrandale.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Your Aunt Susanna.”</p>

<p>“What in thunder do I care what she owns?”</p>

<p>“Because, if you have any sporting blood,
you can own it some day.”</p>

<p>Hugh leaned back in his chair. “Well, you
know how to get around Volstead all right.
I’d like a shot myself.”</p>

<p>“I won’t hint any longer. I’m willing to bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a thousand dollars that you can make Susanna
Frink change her will in your favor.”</p>

<p>Hugh gave a bored smile and did not change
his easy position. “Sorry circumstances
prevent my taking you up.”</p>

<p>“You can pay me when you get the money.”
Ogden was leaning forward in his chair and
smiling, and Hugh turned his head to face
him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll say Carol made an escape,” he
remarked with such unction that his companion’s
smile became a laugh.</p>

<p>“Here’s the idea,” he said. “Your six feet
of good looks nearly sent you into the movies.
Now there’s a stage in Farrandale where you
can vault right into a star part without having
to go through the drudgery of atmosphere
work.”</p>

<p>He paused and Hugh stared at him, no enthusiasm
in his pensive eyes.</p>

<p>“You get yourself some good clothes—Miss
Frink’s leery of the needy; she’s had a diet of
them for fifty years—”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any money,” growled Hugh.</p>

<p>“I have. Don’t interrupt me. You must be
very scrupulous about your personal
appearance. You shave every day. Your shoes are
always blacked.” Hugh looked down. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
go every Sunday to the same church Miss
Frink does, and you apply for a position in the
Ross Graham department store. Miss Frink is
Ross; likewise she is Graham. I supply them
with blankets and I am on sufficiently good
terms with the old lady.”</p>

<p>“Supposing I don’t get the position—and
then again supposing I do,” contemptuously.
“What of it?”</p>

<p>“Here, here, boy, brace up. Did you leave
all your fighting blood in France? You will get
the position, for I shall make it plain that be it
ever so humble, there’s no job so good for your
purposes as one in Ross Graham’s.”</p>

<p>“<em>You’ll</em> make it plain. Say, do you think
you’re writing a play?”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear boy, you’re going to carry a
letter of introduction from me that will explain
to Miss Frink that you are a young man whose
connections have large dry-goods interests,
and, as you wish to learn the workings of
an up-to-date, perfectly equipped department
store, I have advised you to examine the Ross
Graham establishment as an example of
thoroughly good management and success. Your
desire is to begin at the bottom and learn the
business from A to Z.”</p>

<p>“Oh, still pack boxes in a basement,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Hugh, but a light of curiosity began to
shine in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I know Miss Frink; I know what she likes.
She hates dawdlers; she hates failures. She
herself is an example of a successful business
woman. She didn’t inherit money. I have
heard that a tea-room and a peculiarly delicious
candy started her fortune fifty years ago. She
is in the early seventies now, not a hundred and
fifty as you estimated;—and what are the
seventies in these days? Just the youth of old
age.”</p>

<p>“Are you kidding?” returned Hugh.</p>

<p>“I never was more in earnest.”</p>

<p>The boy grunted. “Why, the very name of
Sinclair would give Sukey hydrophobia.”</p>

<p>“That is why you can’t use it,” returned his
mentor promptly. “What was your mother’s
maiden name?”</p>

<p>“Draper, and I suppose that would be anathema,
too.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. She has a wonderful memory.”</p>

<p>“My middle name is Stanwood.”</p>

<p>“That would do. Then the initial on your
clothing would be all right.”</p>

<p>Hugh’s attention was caught. John Ogden
noted that his guest was letting his cigarette go
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>He waited a moment to allow cerebration to
go on.</p>

<p>The boy finally met his eyes again. “You
seem to mean all this business,” he said.</p>

<p>“Money talks,” returned Ogden sententiously.</p>

<p>“You really want to put up money on this
fool idea?”</p>

<p>“It will only be a fool idea if you’re a fool.”</p>

<p>“Well, probably I am.” The boy’s broad
shoulders relapsed against the back of his chair.</p>

<p>His companion frowned and sat forward
more tensely in his own.</p>

<p>“You are Miss Frink’s legitimate heir,” he
said, in a low voice, “but, believe me, there is
no hope of her dying intestate. Are you going
to continue tamely taking one cheap job after
another, being a disgrace to the finest sister a
boy ever had, listening to the disgruntled talk
of a lot of grouchy fellows until you become as
spineless as they are”—</p>

<p>“Say, now,” Hugh sat up, crimsoning.</p>

<p>“Keep still. Are you going on living in a
cloud of cheap tobacco smoke, in a hall bedroom
on a back street, with no ambition for
anything better—”</p>

<p>“Look here—”</p>

<p>“No one stands still,” declared John Ogden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
curtly. “You’re going down if you’re not going
up. You, with your splendid physique, allowing
your backbone to slump like boiled macaroni.
Aren’t you man enough to take a brace
and go to Farrandale and shove that pussy-footing
secretary of your aunt’s out of the place
that should be yours?”</p>

<p>Hugh regarded the suddenly fiery speaker
with open lips.</p>

<p>“He expects to be her heir; everybody knows
he does. He has Miss Frink under his influence
so that the whole household are afraid of him.
There she lives in this great house, with her
servants and this secretary—Grimshaw, his
name is. He has wormed himself into her confidence
until she scarcely makes a move without
him, though she doesn’t realize it herself. Will
you stay here and let him have it all his own
way?”</p>

<p>The speaker scowled into the dark eyes with
the deep, pensive corners that were giving him
their full attention.</p>

<p>“As soon as you told me you were Miss
Frink’s nephew, I saw what you could do; and
for the very same reason that you felt you
could succeed in the movies. Isn’t it Shakespeare
who said: ‘She is a woman, and therefore
to be won’? They’re not a bit different at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
seventy from what they are at seventeen when
they get hold of a man like you.”</p>

<p>Hugh still gaped, and was silent.</p>

<p>“Of course, there must be something inside
your head as well as out. You’ll have to make
self-denials and sacrifices; but who doesn’t who
gets anywhere?”</p>

<p>“You want me to go to Farrandale under an
assumed name,” said Hugh slowly. “I know
what Carol would say. She would say I was
living a lie.”</p>

<p>“Then I should remind your sweet sister that
Stanwood is your own name, and that you are
going on an honorable mission—a rescue
party of one: rescuing yourself from hookworm,
and your aunt from the influence of a smooth-tongued
hypocrite.”</p>

<p>“Hookworm, is it?” said Hugh, frowning,
those curving lips taking a set line.</p>

<p>“Describes it to a T,” returned Ogden
promptly. “Now to-morrow morning, give up
your job. I’ll stay over another day, and we’ll
fit you out and plan details.”</p>

<p>Hugh put out his hand impulsively, and the
older man grasped it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden, why do you take all this
trouble?”</p>

<p>John Ogden smiled. “I’m a sport,” he returned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
“I’m enough of a gambler for this.”</p>

<p>“I do thank you,” said the boy. “I’ve never
made good in my life—”</p>

<p>His companion could see that the strong
teeth set together to hold the lips firm.</p>

<p>“Let’s do this, then,” Ogden returned in a
low voice. “Let’s do it—for Carol.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">AN INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<p>The town of Farrandale was <i lang="fr">en gala</i>. It was the
annual day of rejoicing in its own success and
prosperity. Everybody was happy except Miss
Frink’s horses. The new coachman had drawn
the check reins too tight. They didn’t like the
streamers of bunting; they had objected to the
band; and just as Miss Frink, always the queen
of the occasion, rose in her carriage to say a
few words to her fellow townsmen, a corner of a
temporary platform near them gave way, and
the celebrated bays, Rex and Regina, did what
for some minutes they had been nervously
contemplating: they bolted. The coachman’s
efforts irritated them still more. Miss Frink
was thrown violently against the side of her
chariot, and in the mad, crashing gallop that
ensued she saw her end in the sharp curve of
the railroad they were heading for, and the
advance of an oncoming express train. Some
one else saw it, too, and, springing from the side
of the road, caught the bridle and was dragged
until one of the horses fell down entangled in
the reins the coachman had dropped when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
jumped. The shouting crowd leaping after the
runaway found a very much-shaken queen of
the fête, and an unconscious man lying in the
road with a gash in his head, his hair matted
with blood. The express train crashed by. It
was a flyer that ignored even the thriving little
city of Farrandale. Never was Miss Frink’s
indomitable spirit more regnant than in the
present catastrophe. Somebody picked up the
dazed coachman, who proved to be intact and
able to help disentangle the fallen Rex and get
him to his feet; while others lifted the unconscious
hero. Motors came flying to the scene.
In one was Miss Frink’s secretary, Leonard
Grimshaw, and a pretty young woman with
pure white hair. The latter fell upon Miss
Frink with horrified exclamations; while the
secretary also rushed to the victoria and stood
beside it.</p>

<p>“Oh, had you only allowed me to drive with
you, dear lady!” he mourned.</p>

<p>“Yes, probably the horses wouldn’t have run
away,” returned Miss Frink irritably. She readjusted
her fallen eyeglasses. “Adèle, kindly
leave my bonnet alone.”</p>

<p>“But it is on the side, dear Aunt Susanna.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink looked past them to the unconscious
burden being lifted from the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has any one sent for the ambulance?”
exclaimed the secretary nervously. “Oh, how
shocking, dear Miss Frink! What might have
happened! It makes my blood run cold.”</p>

<p>“It must run cold if you think I’m going to
send that man off in an ambulance,” announced
Miss Frink. “Here, lift him into your car,
Grim, and Adèle, you go for Dr. Morton and
bring him to the house.”</p>

<p>“The house, Miss Frink?” asked the secretary.
“Don’t you mean the hospital, dear
lady?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” snapped the “dear lady.”</p>

<p>One of the gathering crowd came up with a
dusty suitcase. “This must be his,” he said,
and the secretary accepted it, gloomily.</p>

<p>Adèle Lumbard gave one look at the unconscious
face of the rescuer as he was lifted into
the waiting car and Miss Frink took the place
beside him, then she jumped into an eagerly
offered motor and sped away.</p>

<p>Miss Frink leaned out and addressed the
shaken coachman.</p>

<p>“Get the horses home somehow, Foley.”
Then to the increasing crowd: “It is my wish
that you go on with the programme. I am not
hurt in the least, and later Mr. Grimshaw or
Mrs. Lumbard will represent me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>She steadied the form of the injured man
beside her while her secretary drove toward the
house on the outskirts of the town. His brow
was exceedingly dark. He was afraid the cut on
the stranger’s head would stain the upholstery
of the car. Once he turned toward his employer
and made a last effort.</p>

<p>“You know they give them the very best
care at the hospital,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Leonard Grimshaw, I am a lady of the old
school,” returned Miss Frink. “Everybody
was not rushed off to a hospital in my young
days. I probably wouldn’t be here if it was not
for this young man, and I am going to supervise
personally every bone in his body. Drive carefully.
We’ll get there as soon as Dr. Morton
does.”</p>

<p>Her secretary resigned himself, and gave his
attention to avoiding the bumps as a matter of
self-preservation.</p>

<p>Miss Frink was attired in her best in honor of
the state occasion. Her bonnet of black maline
was decorated with white roses, and the maline
lace-edged strings were tied under her chin.
Her handsome dress and wrap were of black
satin. Her hair, though streaked with silver,
still gave the impression of being dark, and it
was crimped in the even waves which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
framed her face for forty years. The face itself,
though lined, was still firm in texture, and her
dark, alert eyes were bright. If she ever wore
spectacles, it must have been in the privacy of
her own room. The eyeglasses on their slender
black ribbon were as inseparable from her
appearance as a feature of her face.</p>

<p>She looked through them now at the unconscious
form beside her, and her spontaneous
thought was: “He is too handsome! I hope I
haven’t killed him!”</p>

<p>The stranger’s long legs were stretched out in
the spacious car, and, as his shoulders slid, Miss
Frink put her arm around them the better to
steady him, and looked anxiously at the matted
hair, relieved to see that it seemed to have
stanched the wound.</p>

<p>“Grim,” she called, “it seems to have
stopped bleeding.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” was the reply, fears for that
upholstery soothed. He turned about enough
to behold the amazing sight of his employer
holding in her embrace the stalwart and fallen
figure.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such a beauty, Grim?”
Miss Frink’s eyes were fixed on the face on
her breast. “What a mercy he wasn’t disfigured!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The secretary’s nostrils dilated. “It won’t
matter much, if it’s concussion of the brain,” he
remarked curtly.</p>

<p>“Grim! Don’t!” exclaimed the lady; and at
the same moment the stranger’s eyelids flickered
and the lashes she had been admiring
lifted. The hero blinked and looked up, dazed,
into the face bending over him. About her lips
flickered a small smile of intense relief.</p>

<p>In a weak voice Hugh spoke: “Have you got
a cigarette?”</p>

<p>“Grim, he wants a cigarette,” said Miss
Frink, her voice wavering. “Have you got
one?”</p>

<p>“Miss Frink,” exclaimed the secretary,
justly shocked. “You ought to know—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so, but you see when the
cat’s away, how do I know what you play? It
would be convenient if you happened to—”</p>

<p>“Oh, the devil,” said Hugh, as he tried to
move.</p>

<p>“What is it? What hurts?” asked Miss
Frink anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my shoulder, I guess. What’s
doing, anyway?” inquired the sufferer feebly,
beginning to realize his satin environment.</p>

<p>“You caught the horses and were dragged.
Don’t you remember? You saved my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly Hugh cerebrated while his pensive
eyes gazed up into the dark ones.</p>

<p>“And I’m so thankful to hear you speak, I
could weep if I ever did, but I don’t indulge.”</p>

<p>John Ogden came floating back into the
dazed, aching head, and all that had preceded
his coming here.</p>

<p>“What did he call you just now?” asked
Hugh with feeble incredulity.</p>

<p>“Miss Frink. I’m Miss Frink,”—with
energy, “and I don’t want to die, and you
saved my life.”</p>

<p>At this Hugh moved his head a little in the
encircling satin, and he made an inarticulate
sound. It was feeble, but it was trying to be a
laugh, and Miss Frink appreciated the beauty
of it.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is sort of funny saving an old
woman, isn’t it, instead of a lovely young girl
as it would be in the story-books?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking—” said Hugh. “Are you—Susanna?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. How did you know it?”</p>

<p>“Because I have a letter of introduction to
you—that’s why I laughed.”</p>

<p>“I should think you might,” dryly. “You
are certainly introduced.—Grim,” sharply,
“what are you doing!” The secretary’s feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
were such that he had increased his speed and
jounced over a rough spot that made Hugh
wince.</p>

<p>“Better not talk,” said Miss Frink. “We’re
nearly there.”</p>

<p>Dr. Morton was waiting for them. Adèle
Lumbard had told him that Aunt Susanna had
a young Greek god in captivity, but that he
needed some restoring.</p>

<p>It proved that the cut in Hugh’s head required
a few stitches, and that his left arm was
broken. Miss Frink still insisting that her home
should be Hugh’s only hospital, he found
himself finally installed in a handsome, spacious
room with a competent and peremptory
nurse.</p>

<p>On Miss Frink’s first visit to his bedside,
where he lay with but one of the blue eyes
peering out from his bandages, and his swathed
arm resting on a pillow, he protested.</p>

<p>“Miss Frink, it’s all absurd,” he said. “I
don’t need a nurse any more than a toad needs a
tail. I can take care of myself perfectly. I have
my right hand. If you’ll just send up some
chow once in a while—”</p>

<p>“Chow,” interrupted Miss Frink thoughtfully.
“You were in the war, of course.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Hugh, smiling at her tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
but with teeth set owing to an assortment of
twinges.</p>

<p>“You must have been wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was. Ask Pershing. Say, Miss
Frink, I don’t like to be all this unnecessary
expense to you.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink continued to look down at him
reflectively. As John Ogden had said, she liked
prosperous folk and had little patience with
derelicts. Had she seen Hugh a few days ago
shuffling along on his way to his job, unshaven,
shabby, and careless, she certainly would not
have looked at him twice, or if she had done so
would have dilated disgusted nostrils at the
odor of his cigarette; but John Ogden had sent
his protégé forth from the hands of a good
tailor and barber; and, had he known the disaster
which befell that fine new suit, would have
rubbed his hands in triumph.</p>

<p>“Don’t fret about expense,” said Miss Frink.
“If it were not for you, I shouldn’t sign any
more checks; and, speaking of checks, where is
yours for your trunk? We must send for it.”</p>

<p>“It’s there in my pocketbook with my letter
of introduction.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink, taking this as permission, found
the pocketbook. She looked at the marking
thereon. “Hugh Stanwood,” she read aloud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
“That is odd,” she said. “Stanwood is one of
our family names.” She looked toward the bed
with a little twitch of her lips. “Perhaps we are
related.”</p>

<p>“Who knows?” returned Hugh, who was
longing for a cigarette.</p>

<p>“May I read this letter of introduction?”</p>

<p>“It is yours,” he answered.</p>

<p>Miss Frink read it attentively. “John
Ogden,” she said aloud as she reached the
signature. “I congratulate you on your friend.
I respect John Ogden very much.”</p>

<p>“So he does you,” returned Hugh feebly,
turning his bandaged head with a weary movement
that his hostess was quick to notice.</p>

<p>He was wishing he had never seen John
Ogden, and that he was back, a free Bolshevist
without the headache, packing boxes with both
hands in a basement, to pay for his hall bedroom
and hot dogs.</p>

<p>Miss Frink, who had sent the nurse out of the
room when she entered, went back to the bedside,
and opened a package she had brought in
with her. Hugh’s one violet eye rolled toward
her listlessly. It suddenly brightened. Miss
Frink had never looked so shame-faced in her
life.</p>

<p>“You see, I went out and bought them myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and not having the least idea what you
liked I told the man to give me a variety.” The
handsome box she opened held a number of
packages of cigarettes, all of a different brand,
and the lover-like smile Hugh gave her as his
eager right hand shot out made color come up
in the guilty face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the nurse won’t let you, I don’t
know,” she said hurriedly—“here, let me
strike the match for you, it is awful to have
only one hand!”</p>

<p>The cigarette was lighted, Miss Frink called
the nurse, and fled to the study where her secretary
was busily sorting papers at his desk. He
was a smooth-shaven man in his late thirties,
immaculate in appearance, his retreating hair
giving him a very high forehead, and his small
mouth with its full lips seeming an appropriate
gateway for his voice and speech which were
unfortunately effeminate.</p>

<p>“Grim,” said Miss Frink upon her sudden
entrance, “Mr. Stanwood has been put in the
White Room and the nurse is with him—Hello,
Adèle, I didn’t see you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard rose from the floor where she
had been sitting Turkish fashion near the book-shelves.</p>

<p>“I was looking for that ‘Life of Mozart,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Aunt Susanna. I thought the ‘Lives of the
Musicians’ were on this lowest shelf.”</p>

<p>“No, upper. Take the ladder. Grim, I want
you to go up to Mr. Stanwood’s room and get
his suit of clothes, and pack them in a box and
send them to his tailor with an order to duplicate
the suit at once. Explain that he has been
in an accident, and that the clothes and bill are
to be sent to me. Here’s his trunk check. Get
that, too. Adèle, why are you here? You know
I wanted you to go back to the festivities.”</p>

<p>“I did, Aunt Susanna,” said the young
woman with conscious rectitude. “I listened to
the speeches and applauded, and answered a
thousand questions about you. Why, you’re
perfectly wonderful, Aunt Susanna. Any other
woman would be lying in bed in a darkened
room with a bandage around her head.”</p>

<p>“One bandage in the family is sufficient,”
said Miss Frink, with a little excited laugh.
“That poor boy upstairs looks as if he had been
through the wars. And he did”—she turned
acutely toward her secretary—“he did go
through the war.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw lifted his high forehead in an
injured manner. “If that is aimed at me, Miss
Frink, I will remind you once again of my helpless
mother and sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes,” said Miss Frink impatiently,
“I know. Scuttle along, Grim, and do the
errand. I believe I’ll jump into your car and
just show myself at the supper at the City
Hall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re wonderful, Aunt Susanna!” exclaimed
Mrs. Lumbard, clasping her pretty
hands. “If you want me to, I’ll—”</p>

<p>“I don’t. I know how it would bore you.
I’ll see that coachman first. I must get rid of
him. I knew the checks weren’t right.”</p>

<p>She swept out of the room as suddenly as she
had entered it, and the two left standing there
looked at each other, their expressions changing
from the solicitude they had worn to gravity.</p>

<p>“If the gods hadn’t intervened,” said Adèle
softly, “to-night we should have been—”</p>

<p>“Sh!” warned the secretary.</p>

<p>“Of course, there would be some charities,”
she went on, her brown eyes shining, “but you
and I, you and I—”</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned the secretary again. “We
can’t be thankful enough that dear Miss
Frink’s life was saved.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard laughed low. “You’ve said it,
Leonard. I don’t think we can.”</p>

<p>“Adèle!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.” She still laughed softly.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">A BOBBED HEAD</span></h2>

<p>As Leonard Grimshaw’s hair gradually deserted
him, he brushed it up in a more and more
aggressive tuft; and as he entered the White
Room now he reminded Hugh of a cockatoo,
with his crest and his slender, sharp nose and
shell-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>“Excuse the intrusion,” he said in his most
dignified and ladylike manner, and, as he gazed
at the one-eyed warrior, his nostrils dilated.
Cigarette smoke was curling above the immaculateness
of the bed. “I come at Miss
Frink’s behest to get your suit of clothes,” he
added coldly.</p>

<p>Hugh removed his cigarette. “What you
going to do with it?” he asked in a rather hollow
voice. “Any needy scarecrows in Farrandale?”</p>

<p>The secretary did not like the stranger’s nonchalant
manner and he declined to smile.</p>

<p>“I am to send it to your tailor to be duplicated.
Miss Frink proposes to pay for it.”</p>

<p>“She’ll have to if anybody does,” remarked
Hugh feebly. “I’m broke. Awfully good of
you, Mr.—Mr.—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grimshaw. I am Miss Frink’s private secretary
and man of affairs.”</p>

<p>“Pompous little birdie,” thought Hugh, and
he regarded his visitor closely with his one eye,
remembering John Ogden’s reference to the
pussy-footing secretary who was to be Miss
Frink’s heir.</p>

<p>The nurse brought the suit to the bedside for
Hugh to empty the pockets. There was the
photograph in its worn leather case, a card, a
handkerchief, some keys, a knife, but the suit
being new had not accumulated the usual
papers and old letters. There was a spotless
pocketbook or billfold, and Hugh smiled ruefully
at sight of it. He knew its contents.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, and left the lot in the
nurse’s hands.</p>

<p>The secretary continued to stare disapprovingly
at the smoke-wreathed bed. As he accepted
the dilapidated suit from the nurse, he
spoke again:</p>

<p>“I feel I should tell you, Mr. Stanwood, that
tobacco is very offensive to Miss Frink, especially
in the form of cigarettes. Of course, you
have put us under great obligation” (Hugh
noted the “us”), “but I must warn you that we
cannot allow the atmosphere of the house to be
vitiated and made disagreeable for Miss Frink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh smiled faintly toward the speaker.
“Fine of you to look out for her,” he said.
“Might shut the transom, nurse.”</p>

<p>The secretary’s full lips drew together and he
glared at this self-possession. Insolence, he
called it. Of course, the man was injured, but,
in consideration of such hospitality as was being
shown him, he might at least act promptly
upon such information.</p>

<p>Leonard returned to Mrs. Lumbard flushed,
and with the little crack in his voice that came
with excitement.</p>

<p>“Lying there, smoking like a young nabob,”
he reported. “I told him Miss Frink’s horror of
tobacco, and he merely asked the nurse to close
the transom. Such nerve!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Adèle, interested, “we
surely knew already that he had nerve: and
isn’t he a beauty?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” returned the other, throwing
down the clothes on a table with a vigor
that suggested a wish that the owner was occupying
them. “Head all bandaged but one
eye, arm bundled up, a general wreck.”</p>

<p>“Let him smoke, then, poor thing, while
Aunt Susanna is off showing Farrandale what
she’s made of. It will be his last for one while.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, Hugh’s last indulgence because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a high fever took possession of the young
adventurer that night, and for a few days Miss
Frink’s physician was a busy man. She paid
scant attention to her other interests until the
boy was sane again; and, although she kept to
the usual hours in her study, the nurse was
instructed to report to her at short intervals.</p>

<p>“It does seem, Miss Frink, as if we ought to
send for his Aunt Sukey,” said this attractive
young woman on one occasion. “He calls for
her incessantly.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink drew her features together in the
sudden grimace which sent her eyeglasses off
her nose.</p>

<p>“How are we going to do that? You looked
through that little trunk of his, I suppose, as I
told you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There wasn’t a scrap of paper in
there, and this is all that was in his pockets.”</p>

<p>The nurse produced the photograph case and
a business card.</p>

<p>Miss Frink examined them. “Yes, there’s
John Ogden’s card. I could send for him, but I
don’t care to have him see just what I managed
to do to his protégé in a few hours. Unless the
boy’s in danger, I won’t send, as yet.” Miss
Frink looked long at the photograph.</p>

<p>“Might be his sister,” she said. “There’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
resemblance. I hope it isn’t a best girl. He’s
too young to be hampered.”</p>

<p>Leonard Grimshaw looked over her shoulder
at the picture. His employer glanced at him
with a humorous twist of her thin lips.</p>

<p>“You’ve kept free, eh, Grim?”</p>

<p>“I had interests which came first,” responded
the secretary, with the reproving tone which he
reserved for implications that he had time for
any thought separate from Miss Frink’s affairs.</p>

<p>That lady returned the old morocco case and
the card to the nurse.</p>

<p>“Keep careful watch,” she said, “and ask
Dr. Morton to report to me at his next visit.
I wish to send for Mr. Ogden if there is occasion
for anxiety.”</p>

<p>The nurse left the room, and the secretary
turned adoring eyes upon his employer.</p>

<p>“If you ever thought of yourself, Miss Frink,
you would see Dr. Morton on your own account.
After the shock you have endured, and
the heroism with which you returned to the
excitement of the banquet, it stands to reason
that your nerves should have a tonic.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks, Grim. I’m all right. All the
tonic I need is to know that I haven’t killed
that boy upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about him,” said the secretary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
looking severely through his dark-rimmed
spectacles. “Other husky men have survived a
broken arm and a bumped head, and I dare say
he will. I feel that I ought to warn you that he
is a person of no delicacy.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink regarded the speaker with narrowed
eyes.</p>

<p>“I rather suspected that,” she said slowly,
“by the way he grabbed my horses’ heads.”</p>

<p>The secretary flushed, but continued indomitably:
“Physical bravery is often allied with a
thick-skinned mentality. I think for your own
protection you should know what I found when
I went to the White Room to get his suit.” He
paused dramatically.</p>

<p>Miss Frink winked off her glasses again and
returned the spectacled gaze with deep interest.
“He was kissing the nurse, perhaps,” she said.
“She is a sweet thing.”</p>

<p>“Miss Frink!” The exclamation was scandalized
as her secretary regarded his lady of the
old school with real amazement. “No. He
was not kissing the nurse, but he was doing
what would affect your comfort far more. He
was smoking cigarettes.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink surprised her companion still
further by laughing.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear him ask me for one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
motor? Now, I say he was clever, with only one
arm and one eye, and laid low in bed, to manage
to get cigarettes.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw stared. “It must have been Dr.
Morton,” he said after a pause; “but the point
is that, when I told him you detested them, he
didn’t stop.”</p>

<p>“He smiled, perhaps?” Miss Frink did,
herself.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember; but I wasn’t going to
stand for that, you may be sure, and I told him
we couldn’t have the atmosphere of this house—your
house, vitiated.”</p>

<p>“Vitiated,” repeated Miss Frink musingly,
“Fine word, Vitiated.”</p>

<p>“Growing childish, upon my soul,” thought
the secretary. “The first break!”</p>

<p>“The point is,” he declared with dignity,
“the significant point is, that he did not stop
smoking. He asked the nurse to close the transom.”</p>

<p>“Poor boy, he needn’t have done that,” said
Miss Frink; “and, by the way, Dr. Morton
didn’t give him the cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he got around the nurse, then.”</p>

<p>“No. She isn’t guilty either; and, Grim”—Miss
Frink paused and put back her eyeglasses
through which she regarded the faithful one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
steadily—“I am entirely prepared to go
around wearing a gas-mask if necessary. I
might be needing one now for brimstone if it
wasn’t for that boy, and he is going to have any
plaything it occurs to him to want. Now, let’s
get at these letters.”</p>

<p>Her secretary blinked, and put one hand to
his temporarily whirling head, while with the
other he automatically gathered up the mail.</p>

<p class="tb">When, toward the close of that eventful gala
day at Farrandale, Miss Frink had courageously
returned to the scene of the festivities,
two girls witnessed the burst of applause which
greeted her as she stepped from her secretary’s
motor.</p>

<p>One of them, a typical flapper, her hair and
her skirt equally bobbed, gazed balefully at the
apparition of the lady of the old school as she
bowed in response to the plaudits of her townspeople.
The other, a gentle-looking, blonde
girl, smiled unconsciously at the black satin
figure, as she joined in the applause.</p>

<p>The eyes of the flapper snapped. “You
shan’t do it, Millicent,” she said, pulling her
friend’s clapping hands apart.</p>

<p>“I must,” laughed Millicent. “I’m a loyal
Ross-Grahamite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>They were sitting in that part of the grandstand
which had not embarrassed Rex and
Regina by falling.</p>

<p>“You can’t be loyal to her and to me, too.
She fired me yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Damaris,” said the blonde girl sympathetically.
“What happened?”</p>

<p>“This,” said Damaris indicating her dark
short locks.</p>

<p>“Just because you had your hair bobbed?
But you ought to have known. She won’t allow
any clerk in the store with bobbed hair.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder she doesn’t insist that all the
men let theirs grow in a braid,” said Damaris
scornfully. “Powdered hair and a queue would
just suit her, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry you lost the position,” said
Millicent. “You really liked reading to her.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, in a way. I liked the salary; but
it cramped my style awfully to go near the
woman. I was always deadly afraid I’d say
something that wasn’t in the book, and I used
to repeat ‘prunes and prisms’ all the way from
my house to her gate to get ready. I’ll never
look at a prune again, nor go near a prism.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she agreeable to work for? I never
spoke to her, but she comes through the store
quite often to look things over, and I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
she’s wonderful. You can feel her power—something
like Queen Elizabeth. Just think
of her grit coming back here this afternoon.
Everybody says she had a miraculous escape.
It must have been an awful shock.”</p>

<p>“I take a little comfort out of that,” remarked
Damaris coolly. “You may be sure
it was the man that was nearly killed. She’s
indestructible, all right.”</p>

<p>The girls glanced down at the seat of honor
where Miss Frink was enthroned during the last
speech of the afternoon, preluding adjournment
of the leading citizens to the banquet.</p>

<p>“How did you get the position, Damaris?”</p>

<p>“Through my unbearable cousin, Leonard
Grimshaw. He’s her secretary.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re an ungrateful rascal!” laughed
Millicent. “I’ve seen Mr. Grimshaw often in
the store”—the speaker caught her breath
and turned grave. “He calls for grandpa’s rent,
too.”</p>

<p>“That nose of his,” said Damaris, “got its
shape entirely from poking into other people’s
affairs.”</p>

<p>“Who is the pretty lady with white hair who
is with him so often?”</p>

<p>“Adèle Lumbard, a <i lang="fr">divorcée</i>; no relation of
Miss Frink’s, but calls her ‘Aunt.’ Think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the lady of the old school having to house a
<i lang="fr">divorcée</i>! It seems that Mrs. Lumbard’s grandmother
was Miss Frink’s best friend, the only
person, I guess, she ever loved in her life. So,
when this girl’s marriage turned out unhappily,
I rather think Miss Frink guessed the fault
wasn’t all on one side, and I’m just sure Miss
Frink took Mrs. Lumbard in as an offering to
her friend who died long ago. I’m just sure of it
because it’s so plain the old woman doesn’t
love her any more than she does anybody else;
only I think she wants to know where Adèle is,
evenings.”</p>

<p>“Why, Damaris! How imaginative you are.
Why doesn’t Mrs. Lumbard read to her, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, why doesn’t she? Just because Adèle’s
reading is one of the 157 varieties of things Miss
Frink doesn’t like.”</p>

<p>“And she liked yours,” said Millicent, her
gentle voice sympathetic again.</p>

<p>“Yes; Leonard got her to try me, and though
she didn’t throw me any bouquets she engaged
me; but she informed me yesterday when we
went to the mat, that my skirts had always distressed
her by being so short, and now my hair
settled it.” The speaker shook her fluffy mane.
“I met Leonard when I went into the house,
and he looked me over with his owl-eyes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
said: ‘You little fool, you’ve done for yourself
now.’ And I had, you see.”</p>

<p>“Is he always so affectionate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as affectionate as a snapping turtle;
but Mother looks up to him as a great man
because he’s closest to Miss Frink of anybody,
and everybody believes he’ll be her heir.”</p>

<p>“Will he help you again?”</p>

<p>Damaris shrugged her shoulders. “I suppose
not. Why don’t you and I open a Beauty
Parlor?”</p>

<p>“One reason is that we haven’t any money.”</p>

<p>“Would you if we had?”</p>

<p>Millicent shook her head. “I can’t take any
chances, Damaris, you know that. My best
plan is not to bob my hair and stick close to
Ross-Graham. Grandfather’s pension is so
small, and our house is old and we have to keep
it in repair, and that costs. Mr. Grimshaw says
our rent is so small he can’t do anything; but
not a day passes that we don’t remember to be
thankful for the ground being big enough for
Grandpa’s garden. We’re very happy.”</p>

<p>Damaris looked curiously into the hazel eyes
regarding her, so full of the warmth of sincerity.</p>

<p>“You’d be a wonderful partner, Millicent.
Even at school I used to feel there was a sort of—well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a sort of perfume around where you
were.”</p>

<p>Millicent laughed. “Damaris, is that a
compliment?”</p>

<p>“Well, sweetness, anyway. You’d get around
the customers every time. You’d really like
them. I would, too, if I could make ’em look
pretty. I’d like to have Miss Frink come in!
Wouldn’t I do her up! Gosh, what she’d look
like when she got out of the chair. Leonard,
too. Wouldn’t I like to give Leonard scalp
massage!” The speaker made a threatening
gesture.</p>

<p>“Damaris!”</p>

<p>“Don’t swear, dear. Say, you haven’t told
me how snappy I look. ‘Chick’s’ the word,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Millicent looked at the dark, sparkling face.
“Yes, but I wish you hadn’t done it, dear.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Damaris sighed. “I can’t put it
back. Mother wept, but I bet I’ll get something
just as good. Mother felt it was so refined
to go to that grand house every day and get
Miss Frink to sleep.”</p>

<p>“To sleep?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I read to her after lunch every day,
and I always left her asleep. That was my
job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Applause for the speech sounded, and Miss
Frink rose.</p>

<p>“There she goes,” said Millicent as they
watched the tall black satin figure rise and take
the arm of the Mayor. “Wonderful! She’s
wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Damaris. “They say the man
that stopped the runaway was awfully hurt.
He may be dead by this time, but what cares
she? She’s back on her job, Queen of Farrandale.”</p>

<p>“But she took him to her own home,” said
Millicent.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Damaris smiled. “In Leonard’s car,
they say. I’ll bet he writhed. Good enough for
him. I hope—”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t. Now, stop, Damaris. Let
us get your mother, and both of you come
home with me to supper.”</p>

<p>“Well, that would be awfully nice, Millicent,”
returned the girl more gently. “You
smell sweeter than usual.” The bobbed head
was somewhat lowered. “You can comfort
Mother if anybody can.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">MRS. LUMBARD</span></h2>

<p>Susanna Frink’s life had included little of the
softer emotions. Of course, acquaintances and
strangers had been voluble behind her back
with suggestions as to what she ought to do.
A woman, especially a rich woman, should have
ties. Even the dignified, handsome, old-fashioned
house she lived in had not been her
family homestead, and it was declared an
absurd purchase for a single woman when she
moved into it nearly twenty years ago. The
grounds, with their fine old trees, pleased her.
The high iron fence, with the elaborate gates
opening upon the driveway, pleased her. In the
days of her restaurant—tea-house they would
call it now—and candy-making, she had
looked upon this house as fulfilling every idea
she had ever had of elegance, and, when it fell
to the possession of a globe-trotting bachelor
who had no use for it, she bought it at a bargain
as was her successful habit.</p>

<p>Those early business days had been shared by
another girl, gay Alice Ray, and to this partner
of her joys and sorrows Susanna gave her heart.
It almost broke when Allen Morehouse married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Alice and carried her off to the Far West. The
two corresponded for years, but gradually the
epistolary bond dissolved. Miss Frink grew
more and more absorbed in business, and the
courageous, cheery chum of her girlhood came
seldom to her mind until one day she received a
letter signed “Adèle Lumbard.” It enclosed
a picture of Alice Ray similar to one in Miss
Frink’s possession, and the writer claimed to
be Alice’s granddaughter. She stated that she
was alone in the world having been divorced
after an unhappy marriage, and, not knowing
which way to turn, had thought of the friend
her grandmother had loved so devotedly, and
wondered if for the sake of auld lang syne Miss
Frink would be willing to see her and give her
advice as to what to do.</p>

<p>Divorced! Susanna Frink’s eyebrows drew
together. The lady of the old school had no
patience with divorce. But here was Alice
Ray’s granddaughter. Susanna looked at the
picture, a smiling picture that through all the
ups and downs of her life had stood on her
dresser: an enlargement of it hung on her wall.
There was no other picture in the room. Memories
stirred. She had no sense of outgoing
warmth toward the writer of the letter; but a
divorce was a scandalous thing. What had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
girl done? Worse still, what was she likely to
do if left to herself?</p>

<p>Miss Frink had no private charities. She
gave through her secretary to the worthy
organizations whose business it was to look
after such matters, and troubled herself no
further about them. Her secretary took care
that the frequent letters of appeal should never
reach her, but when he read Mrs. Lumbard’s,
and saw the photograph, he knew that this did
not come under the usual head; and so Miss
Frink was now looking into Alice Ray’s sweet
eyes, and the smile which seemed to express
confidence that her good pal Susanna would not
fail her.</p>

<p>Miss Frink sent for Adèle Lumbard, and that
young woman’s heart bounded with relief and
hope. She knew all about Miss Frink—indeed,
so closely had she kept apprised of her reputation
for cold shrewdness that she had grave
doubts as to the reception of her letter, and the
curt lines of invitation rejoiced her. The old
photograph was returned to her without comment.</p>

<p>When she reached the big house, it was no
surprise to have a maid show her to her room
and tell her that Miss Frink would see her in
the drawing-room in an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>A sensitive soul would have been chilled by
such a reception. Adèle Lumbard’s soul was
not sensitive, but her body was, and she wholly
approved of the linen in her bathroom and on
her bed, fine in texture and all monogrammed.
She liked the <i lang="fr">chaise longue</i> and the luxurious
chairs. Her windows looked out on heavy-leafed
maples and graceful birches rising from a
perfectly kept lawn. A pergola and a fountain
were charmingly placed.</p>

<p>“If she’ll only take a fancy to me!” thought
Adèle.</p>

<p>Those piercing eyes of Miss Frink’s studied
the pretty woman who entered the room at the
appointed time. Perhaps there had been stirrings
of hope that the newcomer might bring
reminders of the one being she had loved with
all her heart. If so, the hope died. Adèle’s dark
eyes and ivory skin surmounted by the fluffy,
snowy hair were striking, but as unlike the
cheery brown and rose of sweet Alice Ray as it
was possible to imagine.</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s cold dry hand gave the plump
smooth one a brief shake.</p>

<p>“Be seated, Mrs. Lumbard!”</p>

<p>“Oh, must you say that!” was the impulsive
response. “Do call me Adèle for Grandmother’s
sake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sorry you got a divorce. I am a
woman of the old school,” was the uncompromising
reply.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t wish me to live with a bad
man?” The dark eyes opened with childlike
appeal.</p>

<p>“No; but you needn’t have divorced him.”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t, he would always be pestering
me.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a Southerner.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Didn’t Grandmother tell you her son
went South and married there?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I don’t remember. How old are
you?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight. You’re looking at my hair.
In a single night, Aunt Susanna—Oh, excuse
me,” with apparently sudden shyness, “Grandmother
always spoke of you to us all as our
Aunt Susanna. We were taught to love your
picture.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink felt slightly pitiful toward that
“single night” statement and she kept the
thought of her Alice in mind.</p>

<p>“I don’t like harrowing details,” she said
curtly, “so I won’t ask for them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much”—with a pretty
gesture of outgoing hands—“I do so loathe
going over it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“No wonder. I’m glad to see you don’t
paint your face or dye your hair.”</p>

<p>The dark eyebrows lifted in surprise. “That’s
the way I was raised, Aunt Susanna,” was the
meek reply.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better stay on here a while,”
said Miss Frink at last, “and we’ll think what
it will be best for you to do. Let us see. How
long ago did Alice—did your grandmother
die?”</p>

<p>The dark eyes looked off in thought. “I was
a little girl. It must be about fifteen years
now.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink nodded.</p>

<p>“What an old Tartar!” thought Adèle that
night as she went to bed; but she had landed, as
she expressed it to herself, and possession was
nine points of the law. She hugged herself for
her cleverness in eschewing rosy cheeks and
having nothing on her hands but the slender
wedding ring.</p>

<p>In the careful study she had made of Miss
Frink and her surroundings before coming here,
she had learned about Leonard Grimshaw. The
rumor was that, although Miss Frink had not
really adopted him, he was the closest factor in
her life; and when Adèle met him at dinner that
first evening, and found that he was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
guest, but living in the house, she realized still
further his importance. Realized also that he
might resent her claims, and so she set herself
to win his regard; while he, hearing her call
Miss Frink “Aunt Susanna” unrebuked, understood
that she was to be accepted.</p>

<p>They quickly formed a tacit alliance. Adèle’s
efforts to get on intimate terms with the
Queen of Farrandale were steadily repulsed, but
her pride was not hurt as she observed that
Miss Frink treated everybody with the same
brusqueness. She discerned that the one sentiment
of her hostess’s life was still a living
memory. The two pictures Miss Susanna kept
near her proved it, and one day, a week after
Adèle’s arrival, when the lawyer came and was
closeted alone with Miss Frink for an hour,
Mrs. Lumbard felt jubilantly certain that the
visit was for the purpose of inserting her own
name in the old lady’s will.</p>

<p>Adèle longed to become necessary in some
way to her hostess. It was absurd for Leonard’s
young cousin to be coming every day to read to
her. She made an excuse to read something
aloud one day, but Miss Frink interrupted her.</p>

<p>“I am blunt, Adèle. I don’t have time for
beating about the bush, and your reading
makes me nervous. It’s all vowels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Aunt Susanna,” returned the
young woman meekly. “I do so wish I could do
something for you—the little while I’m here.”
The guest was always referring to the brevity
of her visit, but weeks were slipping by. “Do
you care for music?”</p>

<p>“Yes, moderately,” said Miss Frink carelessly.
“There’s a Steinway grand down in the
drawing-room. I don’t know when it has been
touched.”</p>

<p>“I noticed that and was so tempted, but I
didn’t want to play without your permission.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go ahead any evening. I don’t want a
racket in the daytime.”</p>

<p>So that very evening Adèle, in the simple
black georgette gown which made her white
throat and arms dazzling, sat down at the piano
in the empty drawing-room and had the triumph
of seeing Miss Frink come through the
portières in evident surprise, and sit down with
folded hands to listen to the finished runs that
were purling across the neglected keys.</p>

<p>It was two weeks after Adèle’s arrival that
Rex and Regina ran away; and, in the excitement
of Hugh’s illness, Mrs. Lumbard had
sufficient adroitness not to risk irritating Miss
Frink’s rasped nerves. The piano was closed
and she effaced herself as much as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The secretary’s exasperation at the intrusion
of the young hero beneath their roof amused
her. He confided to her the paralyzing proof of
Miss Frink’s indulgence in the matter of the
cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Oh, if she would only go around the family!”
sighed Adèle.</p>

<p>Grimshaw gave her one look of surprise, then
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“That would certainly be the shortest way
out of the house for you,” he said dryly.</p>

<p>Adèle colored. “You know very well you’d
like it, too.”</p>

<p>“If I did, that would be a very different
matter. I’m disgusted with the women of
to-day.”</p>

<p>The secretary was sitting at his desk, and
Mrs. Lumbard was in the usual pose of hunting
for a book which she always adopted in her
visits to the study lest the lady of the old school
should come in upon their interview. Grimshaw
had a sort of fascination for her inasmuch
as his position was certainly the one nearest the
throne, and he had a large and undisputed
authority in Miss Frink’s affairs. Adèle’s closest
watch had never been able to discern any
evidence of personal attachment in Miss Frink
for her secretary, and he certainly had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
cause of jealousy for Adèle on that score. This
fact, more than her physical attractiveness,
caused him to accept her friendly overtures
and even to relieve himself occasionally in an
exasperated burst of confidence.</p>

<p>For the first five years of his employment by
Miss Frink he had been youthfully docile,
attentive, and devoted to learning her business
affairs. At the end of that period she invited
him for convenience to reside in her house, and
from that time on he had been playing for the
large stake which everybody believed he would
win.</p>

<p>He learned her likes and dislikes, never allowed
his devotion to lapse into servility, and,
with apparent unconsciousness of catering to
her, kept early hours, read a great deal, and
played with her endless games of double solitaire.</p>

<p>She sometimes suggested that he seek a wider
social life, but to such hints he always replied,
with a demure dignity in amusing contrast to
her brusque strength, that his manner of life
suited him excellently, but that if she wished to
entertain he was at her service. Miss Frink at
times thought remotely that she should like to
entertain. She had taken much interest in
perfecting the details of her home, inside and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
out; but, when she came up against the question
of setting a definite date and issuing invitations,
she was stirred with the same apprehensions
a fish might be supposed to undergo if
asked to take a stroll around the garden. She
spoke of the matter sometimes, and her secretary
bowed gravely and assured her that he was
quite ready to take her orders; but the fish
always turned away from such considerations
and dived a little deeper into the congenial
discussion of her business matters.</p>

<p>Leonard Grimshaw thought very highly of
himself in the present, and had many secret
plans for an important and powerful future.</p>

<p>He looked now scornfully at Adèle standing
by the bookcase with her self-convicted blush.</p>

<p>“I am disgusted with the women of to-day,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we smoke as well as you?”
asked Adèle.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” he returned finally, his eyes fixed
on the papers on his desk. “You try it once
here, and you’ll find it will be a few degrees
worse than Damaris bobbing her hair.”</p>

<p>“Poor youngster,” said Adèle. “I must say,
Aunt Susanna—”</p>

<p>“Well, what?” said Miss Frink, suddenly
coming into the room, “Aunt Susanna what?”—she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
went to the desk and threw down some
papers. “File those, Grim. Speak, and let the
worst be known, Adèle.”</p>

<p>The secretary certainly admired his colleague
as he rose to his feet. Without altering her
pose, Adèle’s voice melted into the meek and
childlike tone of her habit.</p>

<p>“I was speaking of what a marvel it is that
you have had no reaction from the excitement
of that dreadful day. That is what it is to be a
thoroughbred, Aunt Susanna.”</p>

<p>“Thorough-nothing,” snorted the lady.
“What was the use of my lying down and
rolling over because I wasn’t hurt?”</p>

<p>“And Rex is all right again, isn’t he?” said
Adèle.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s got over his scratch, and the new
coachman does you credit, Grim. He has
decent ideas about a check rein. Order the
horses for me at three. Dr. Morton says it
will not hurt Mr. Stanwood to go for a short
drive.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink hurried out of the room, and the
two she left in it stared at each other. Adèle
smothered a laugh behind a pretty hand, but
the secretary had forgotten her smooth diplomacy
in his annoyance.</p>

<p>“I wonder if she is going with him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
nurse is quite enough,” he said, as if to himself.</p>

<p>“I wish she’d ask me to go,” said Adèle. “I
haven’t had a glimpse of him since I saw him
lifted out of the road.”</p>

<p>“Nor she, much,” said Grimshaw. “She has
had the nurse make frequent reports, but she
hasn’t been in the sick-room at all. Why should
she be bothered?”</p>

<p>“No reason, of course. She is not exactly a
mush of love and sympathy. What I was really
going to say, Leonard, was that I don’t see how
a young attractive man like you entombs himself
away from his kind the way you do, and
must have done for years.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw raised his eyebrows as one accepting
his due, and brushed back his thin crest of
hair, with a careless hand.</p>

<p>“I work pretty hard,” he said.</p>

<p>Adèle looked apprehensively toward the
door, then back at him.</p>

<p>“Is it always like this?” she breathed in a
hushed voice.</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>“Days all alike. Evenings all alike.” Adèle
clenched her hands. “Nobody coming, nobody
going. Why haven’t you dried up and blown
away!”</p>

<p>Grimshaw regarded her. She had undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
become somewhat of a safety-valve for his
feelings, since the day when Miss Frink brought
a foreign body into the ordered régime of the
big silent house, but he could do without her.
He would rather do without everybody. His
eyes behind the owl spectacles had a slight
inimical gleam.</p>

<p>“Why do you stay if you don’t like it?” he
returned.</p>

<p>The young woman straightened up resentfully.</p>

<p>“For the same reason you do,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“That is a very silly remark,” he said coldly.
“A business man stays by his business interests.”</p>

<p>She regarded him in silence, and her stiff
posture relaxed. He was powerful and she was
powerless. She had put herself in his power
many times. He could undo her with Miss
Frink any hour.</p>

<p>“I’m alone in the world, Leonard,” she said,
suddenly becoming self-pitying. “I’m so glad
to have found a friend in you. Don’t desert me.
I’d love Aunt Susanna if she would let me.”</p>

<p>“Better not try it on,” returned the secretary
dryly, and again seated himself at his desk.</p>

<p>“But I’m human!” she exclaimed, suddenly
appealing, “and I’m young. Can’t we ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
have any fun? Aren’t there any trusties in this
prison?”</p>

<p>“Adèle!” He looked up suddenly and his
voice cracked. “Keep these ideas to yourself,
if you please. This is no prison. You can go
free any day.”</p>

<p>She caught her breath. She longed to tell
him he was a cautious prig; but for the first
time she felt afraid of him. He had confided in
her somewhat in his irritation at the stranger
upstairs, but that idea was no longer a novelty,
and now she felt that he was safely withdrawing
into his shell.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">VISITING THE SICK</span></h2>

<p>As her secretary had said, it was Miss Frink’s
policy to keep away from the White Room.
Experts, the doctor and the nurse, had charge
of it. Why should she hover about like a fussy
old hen, getting in the way and causing confusion?
She had her business to attend to, and
there was no reason why her life should not go
on as systematically as before.</p>

<p>So she argued. Nevertheless, this was more
easily said than done. She had been shocked
out of her rut, and so long as that stalwart
figure in bed in the White Room remained
recumbent, she knew she could not really settle
into her usual state of mind.</p>

<p>Miss Damon, the nurse, came to her three
times a day with reports, and they were the
interesting moments of the day to her. This
noon she awaited the visit with unusual eagerness;
and she hailed the young woman with a
cheerful greeting.</p>

<p>“Dr. Morton says Mr. Stanwood may go for
a drive this afternoon,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes; he is sitting up by the window now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Miss Frink. I thought perhaps you would like
to come in and visit him. He is rather low-spirited,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Is he? Is he?” responded Miss Frink
tensely. “What do you think he wants?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just to get well, I suppose. Convalescence
is the hardest part after such a fever as
he has had.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll come,” said Miss Frink, straightening
herself valiantly, and she followed to the
White Room, where in an armchair by the
window sat a young man with long, pensive
eyes. He was wearing, besides a gloomy expression,
a small mustache and short beard carefully
trimmed. A soft blanket was folded about
his shoulders and another spread over the feet
that rested on a cushioned stool.</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s startled eyes drew from the
nurse the explanation that Dr. Morton had not
wished the patient to be shaved as yet, and
there was no change of expression in the pale,
handsome face as Hugh looked up at her
approach.</p>

<p>“Are you willing to shake hands with the old
thing that got you into this mess?” inquired
the visitor, and Hugh took her offered hand.</p>

<p>“I see they let you look out of both eyes
now.” She seated herself near him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, that scratch is all right,” he responded.</p>

<p>“Miss Damon thought I would be a cheerful
visitor; but I suppose I’ll never look cheerful to
you. Now I just want to know if there is anything
more we can do for you than is being
done.” Miss Frink’s emphatic tone had its
usual businesslike ring. “Don’t you want to
smoke?”</p>

<p>At this Hugh’s mustache did curve upward a
little, showing a line of gleaming teeth.</p>

<p>“You don’t like it,” he returned.</p>

<p>“Who said so? Anyway, you’ll teach me.”</p>

<p>Hugh’s smile widened. “She is a good old
sport,” he reflected.</p>

<p>“I don’t want that now,” he said, grave
again.</p>

<p>“Well, is there anything on your mind?”
pursued Miss Frink. The nurse had left the
room. Her taciturn patient had never said an
unnecessary word to her. Perhaps his hostess
would have more success.</p>

<p>“Now, your Aunt Sukey,” went on Miss
Frink in a gentler tone than could have been
expected from her. “Don’t be surprised that
we know about your Aunt Sukey; for you
called for her incessantly in your delirium,
and I assure you if you would like to see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it will give me all the pleasure in the world to
send for her and have her stay as long as you
like.”</p>

<p>The effect of this offer astonished the speaker.
Color slowly flowed up all over the pale face,
and Hugh grinned.</p>

<p>“Did I really call for her? Priceless! No, no,
Miss Frink. You’re a trump, but I don’t want
her sent for.”</p>

<p>“Not on good terms, then, I judge from the
way you take it.”</p>

<p>“No, we’re not. You’ve hit the nail on the
head. I imagine that’s your way.” Still coloring,
he met the solicitous eyes bent upon him
as Miss Frink grimaced her glasses off.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is opposing a love affair. Don’t
mind an old woman’s plain speaking; but, of
course, we saw the sweet face in your photograph,
and it doesn’t seem as if there could be
anything wrong with that girl. I like the
quaint way she does her hair. I’m a lady of the
old school, and it’s refreshing to see a coiffure
like that in this day of bobbed idiots. Did
Aunt Sukey oppose her?”</p>

<p>“With tooth and nail,” replied Hugh. “You
are a mind reader.”</p>

<p>“Well—dear boy”—Miss Frink hesitated—“I
want to do anything in this world I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for you. Are you sure I can’t do anything in
this matter?”</p>

<p>“It’s a little late,” said Hugh.</p>

<p>“Never too late to mend,” returned Miss
Frink stoutly and hopefully. She regarded the
beauty of her companion, considering him in
the rôle of a lover. “You look just as if you
were ready to sing ‘Faust,’” she said. “I shall
call her Marguerite until you tell me all about
it.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink little suspected that she had set
fire to a train of thought which hardened her
companion against her, and accented the repugnance
to the part he was playing; a repugnance
which had dominated him ever since the
breaking of his fever.</p>

<p>Many times he had definitely made up his
mind that, the minute sufficient strength returned,
he would disappear from Farrandale
and repay John Ogden every cent of his investment
if it took years to accomplish it. Two
things deterred him: one, his last interview
with Ogden in which the latter reminded him of
his lack of initiative and self-control—in other
words, his spinelessness. That stung his pride.
“Remember,” said John Ogden, “of the unspoken
word you are master. The spoken word
is master of you.” The other incentive to continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the rôle in which he had made such a
triumphant début was Miss Frink’s secretary.
Hugh was a youth of intense likes and dislikes
very quickly formed. In spite of himself he
liked his brusque, angular hostess. To be sure,
saving any one’s life creates an interest in the
rescued, but it was not only that. Hugh liked
the sporting quality of his great-aunt. He liked
the way she had done her duty by him and not
fussed around the sick-room. She was a good
fellow, and he didn’t like her to be under the influence,
perhaps domination, of the spectacled
cockatoo who was also, in his own estimation,
cock of the walk. If Miss Frink had kept away
from the White Room, Leonard Grimshaw
had not done so. He came in frequently
with a masterful air and the seriousness with
which he took himself, and his patronizing
manner to patient and nurse grated on the
convalescent.</p>

<p>“I’ll be darned if I’ll leave Aunt Sukey to
him,” was the conclusion Hugh invariably
reached after one of his visits.</p>

<p>“There is something on my mind, Miss
Frink,” said Hugh, now, “and that is Mr. Ogden.
I’m sure he is wondering why he doesn’t
hear from me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write him at once,” said Miss Frink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“It shall go out this afternoon. We’ll mail it together.”</p>

<p>The patient’s long eyes rolled toward her
listlessly.</p>

<p>“Yes. You’re going for a drive with me. Dr.
Morton says you may.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” returned Hugh. “Not until I get a
little more starch in my legs, I guess. I can
barely get to this chair from the bed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course the butler and the coachman
will carry you over the stairs.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, no. I prefer not to be handled like
a rag doll.”</p>

<p>“What have you got that blanket on for?”
demanded Miss Frink, suddenly becoming conscious
of the patient’s garb.</p>

<p>“Why—” John Ogden in his preparations
for his protégé had not had the foresight to prepare
for inaction on his part. “I—I haven’t
any bathrobe with me.”</p>

<p>Here the door opened and Leonard Grimshaw
walked in. It entertained Hugh to note
the abasement of the uplifted crest as the secretary
saw his employer.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon. I didn’t know you were here,
Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>“Whether you knew it or not, you might
have knocked,” she retorted. “Look here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Grim, Mr. Stanwood doesn’t wish to drive to-day,
so I am going now instead of later.”</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Frink?” deferentially. “Luncheon
will be served in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>“Now,” repeated Miss Frink. “There is an
errand I wish to do. Order the horses at once,
please.”</p>

<p>The secretary bowed in silence and withdrew.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, old girl. You know your own
mind,” thought Hugh, and at that moment the
nurse appeared with a tempting tray. The patient
regarded it with a little less apathy than
usual. The last few minutes had been an appetizer.</p>

<p>Miss Frink rose. “Eat all you can, my boy. I
shall let you see my letter to Mr. Ogden before I
mail it.”</p>

<p>“Do you know his address?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; Ross Graham buys of him. To
tell the truth, I should have written him long
before this if it hadn’t been I was ashamed to
have him know the reception I gave his friend.”</p>

<p>Hugh smiled faintly. Age must have ripened
Aunt Sukey. She was certainly a good sort.
Grimshaw couldn’t put it over her whatever
Mr. Ogden might think. Hugh still smiled as he
thought of the depressed crest, and the deference
of that voice so full of unction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The secretary shook his head as he departed
on his errand. To postpone luncheon—why,
it was nearly as unheard of as to connive at
cigarettes!</p>

<p>“She’s breaking—breaking,” he reflected.
“It’s the beginning of the end.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">AT ROSS GRAHAM’S</span></h2>

<p>The horses were at the door, likewise the secretary.
He had encountered Mrs. Lumbard in
the hall, and informed her that the luncheon
gong would not sound at present.</p>

<p>She lifted her shoulders. “Curfew shall not
ring to-night! Why the <i lang="fr">bouleversement</i>?”</p>

<p>“Miss Frink wishes to do an errand.”</p>

<p>“It must be a marvelous one that won’t
wait.”</p>

<p>The crest was lifted high. “She behaves very
strangely,” was the dignified reply. “She is”—Grimshaw
tapped his temple—“somewhat
changed since her shock. It betrays itself in
many ways. My deeply beloved and respected
Miss Frink!” He shook his head.</p>

<p>Adèle gazed at him curiously, with little
whimsical twitches at the corners of her lips.
“We can’t expect anything else at her age,” she
replied, in the low tone that he had used.</p>

<p>The subject of their remarks now appeared at
the head of the stairs, dressed for her drive.
She looked a little annoyed to see the couple
waiting below together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, well,” she said testily. “I am not going
on a journey. You look as if you were waiting
to bid me a long farewell.”</p>

<p>“Would you like me to go with you?”
asked Mrs. Lumbard. “I can get my hat
very quickly.”</p>

<p>As Miss Frink reached the foot of the stairs,
she returned the young woman’s eager gaze
coolly. “I am not in the least shy of asking
your company when I want you, Adèle,” she
returned, pulling on her gloves. “Any last
wishes, Grim?”</p>

<p>“I am simply waiting to put you in your carriage,
dear lady,” he returned, injured dignity
again to the fore.</p>

<p>“All right,” brusquely. “Order lunch to be
served in three quarters of an hour; and, Adèle,
Mr. Stanwood doesn’t feel ready to come downstairs
yet, but he’s sitting up, and you might
open the piano again. There is no objection to
your playing if you feel like it. He might like it—in
the distance.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard lingered until the secretary
had his employer safely ensconced and the glistening
horses had driven away. She watched
him come up the path, and then went out on
the wide veranda behind the white columns to
meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grim by name and grim by nature,” she
said, laughing. “You look funereal.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make silly jokes,” he snapped. “I
should think you had had a snub to last you for
one while.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it right between the eyes?” she returned
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Everything that dear Miss Frink says is
straight from the shoulder always,” said her secretary.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to say straight
from the heart. No wonder you call her ‘dear.’
So ingratiating, so affectionate.”</p>

<p>“That is enough of that,” said Leonard
curtly. “I am here to protect Miss Frink—even
from her poor relations.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard crimsoned to the roots of her
white hair. “That is a nasty, insulting thing to
say.” The brown eyes scintillated. “The sacred
lunch hour is postponed. I may play in the
daytime. If you are here to protect Miss Frink,
you would better let her relatives take care of
themselves, and turn your attention to the crippled
Greek god she has been visiting the last
hour. Don’t you know, as well as I do, that she
has gone on some errand for him? Perhaps not
cigarettes this time, but for something he wants,
and wouldn’t you be glad if I could have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
with her and found out what it was? You won’t
get anywhere by insulting me, Leonard Grimshaw.”</p>

<p>“There, there, Adèle.” The secretary was
coloring, too. He disliked hearing put into
words the thoughts that had been grumbling in
the back of his head; but Mrs. Lumbard flashed
past him and into the house, and, hurrying
to open the piano, in a minute the crashing
chords of a Rachmaninoff Prelude were sounding
through the house. Every time those strong
white hands came down, it was with a force
which might have been shaking the cockatoo
crest.</p>

<p>In the White Room the convalescent’s pensive
eyes widened. “Who can that be?” he
asked the nurse.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’ve no idea, Mr. Stanwood. It
sounds like a man. Perhaps it is Mr. Grimshaw.”</p>

<p>“Say, if it is, he’s some good, after all. Only
that’s a punk thing he’s playing. That stuff’ll
do when you’re dead. Would you mind going
down and asking him if he knows anything
from ‘The Syncopated Playfellows’?”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to, Mr. Stanwood.” And
Miss Damon went downstairs and stood outside
the entrance to the drawing-room until the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dignified chord was dying away, then she entered.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Lumbard!” she exclaimed in
surprise; “we thought it was a man.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was,” said Adèle vindictively, “and
that I was just going to fight a duel, and had
the choice of weapons. I’d choose horsewhips
and I guarantee I’d get there first.”</p>

<p>Miss Damon’s demure little mouth smiled
leniently. “Mr. Stanwood sent me down. He
was very pleased to hear music, and we thought
it might be Mr. Grimshaw; and Mr. Stanwood
wanted me to ask him if he could play something
from ‘The Syncopated Playfellows.’”</p>

<p>Adèle’s eyes grew their widest. “Goodness,
he’s human then if he did come from Olympus!”
The eyes brightened. “To think of having
a live one in the house! It’s the jazziest kind
of jazz, Miss Damon. I might just as well meet
Miss Frink at the door with a string of profanity.
Will you stand at the window and watch
for the carriage while I loosen up?”</p>

<p>She plunged at once into the audacious
rhythm and jerking melody requested, and
it was not long before Leonard Grimshaw’s
pointed nose and amazed spectacles appeared
between the heavy satin portières. Adèle
flashed defiance at him and pounded on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
complicated way. The secretary felt beating
symptoms in his feet, but he still glared.</p>

<p>The barbaric strains came to a close.</p>

<p>“I’m surprised,” he said.</p>

<p>“You look it,” retorted the musician.</p>

<p>Miss Damon glided from the room and upstairs.
She found enthusiasm in the pale face
of her patient.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Grimshaw isn’t so dusty, after
all. Why, he’s a wizard.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Mr. Grimshaw. It was a Mrs.
Lumbard, a niece of Miss Frink’s, who lives
here.”</p>

<p>“Lives here? I wonder why she hasn’t
played before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Fink wouldn’t allow the piano
opened while you were ill, Mr. Stanwood.”</p>

<p>“Say”—Hugh looked out the window
thoughtfully—“she’s been awfully white to
me. Miss or Mrs. Lumbard did you say?”
looking back at the nurse.</p>

<p>“Mrs. She’s a widow with white hair. Quite
pretty.”</p>

<p>“H’m! She’d better have her hair dyed if
she’s going to play like that. It’s a wonder it
doesn’t turn red and curl of its own accord.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Frink had directed her
liveried coachman to drive to Ross Graham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Company’s. Rex and Regina would probably
have gone there if left to themselves, so often
did they traverse the road. Holding their heads
high, their silver harness jingling, they, like
their mistress, seemed to be scorning the parvenu
motors among which they threaded their
way.</p>

<p>Arrived at the store, Miss Frink told the new
coachman where to wait—it was a nuisance to
have to break in new servants, to have to initiate
a novice into her established customs. She
supposed the man who had held that position
for so many years could not help dying; nevertheless,
if he had not done so Rex and Regina
would never have run away with her; and, as
she left the victoria with this reflection, another
consideration followed close on its heels. She
would never have known Hugh Stanwood. A
softened expression grew around her thin lips.</p>

<p>Yes, she would probably have received him
into the store to please John Ogden, but she
would never have taken any notice of him. The
clerks in the big establishment held just the
same place in her consideration as the lights, or
the modern fixtures for carrying cash.</p>

<p>She entered the store and was met by a
deferential floorwalker.</p>

<p>“How do, Mr. Ramsay. Where are the men’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
dressing-gowns or bathrobes or smoking-jackets,
or whatever you call ’em?”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s quite flattering, Miss Frink. I
didn’t know that you trusted the manager to
plan a department out of your knowledge.”</p>

<p>“That is because you don’t know me, then.
I make certain that a person is competent, and
after that I don’t tie any strings to him; but
this is the first time in my life I ever bought
anything for a man. I hope you’ve got something
decent.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Miss Frink”—they were
walking toward the back of the store, and
every unoccupied clerk was casting furtive
glances at the eagle-eyed proprietor—“that’s
heresy, you know. New York might come over
here and take a few lessons from our stock.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s lips twitched. It was her usual
manner of smiling.</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it. Now, prove it.”</p>

<p>They reached the section desired, and Mr.
Ramsay nodded to a blonde girl busy with her
cash book.</p>

<p>“Dressing-gowns, Miss Duane”—then he
bowed and moved away.</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s bright gaze fixed on the clerk.
“Haven’t I seen you somewhere else?” she
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Madam,” returned the girl. “I am in
the glove section, but Miss Aubrey has gone
out to lunch, so I’m over here.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about the stock?”</p>

<p>Millicent colored under this abruptness, but
she smiled.</p>

<p>“Not very much, but I can show you what
we have.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink liked her tone and manner.</p>

<p>“Human intelligence, eh?—Do you know
who I am?” with sudden consideration that
perhaps this sweetness was for the occasion.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Miss Frink. We all know you.
I have fitted you to gloves.”</p>

<p>The lady of the old school still regarded the
blonde head with its simple twist of hair carried
back from a low broad forehead. “I was sure I
had seen you. Are you always patient with
people that snap you up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I might lose my job if I wasn’t.”
The girl laughed a little.</p>

<p>The wholesomeness of her, with her color
coming and going, pleased her customer, but
above all the charm of her low-pitched voice
attracted Miss Frink.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get at it, then,” she said. “I want
a dressing-gown for a man who is recovering
from a severe accident and beginning to sit up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent approached a series of hangers,
Miss Frink close on her heels.</p>

<p>“What size does he wear?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows, but he’s built on the quantity
plan.”</p>

<p>“Takes a large size, then.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea.”</p>

<p>“How about this?” Millicent drew out a
garment covered with Persian figures.</p>

<p>“Take it away, child. I don’t want a Sheik
pattern.”</p>

<p>The girl tried next a soft blue wool wrapper
with cord and tassels.</p>

<p>“Nor a baby bunting,” snapped Miss Frink.
“I tell you he’s a he-man.”</p>

<p>Millicent could feel the tears of amusement
pressing to her eyes, but she was quite frightened
at the same time. The customer towered
so above her and now began pulling over the
gowns with her own hands.</p>

<p>“Look here, haven’t you got something
handsome?” demanded Miss Frink at last.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure we have what any one has,”
stammered Millicent. “I thought if it was for
a sick person, something soft—”</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t going to be sick all his life, I
hope.”</p>

<p>Millicent hurried to some drawers at one side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and opening one drew forth a dressing-gown of
heavy black satin on which were printed small
wine-colored flowers. Each one burst into
brightness with one crimson petal, giving an
effect of jewels. The rich cord and tassels
showed threads of crimson.</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s expression was one she had
probably not worn since she was confronted by
her first wax doll with real hair. She grimaced
her eyeglasses off.</p>

<p>“Well, I think better of Ross Graham,” she
said, after an eager pause.</p>

<p>“It is very rich,” remarked the saleslady,
demurely.</p>

<p>“Not too rich for his blood, I guess,” said
Miss Frink, handling the lustrous fabric and
putting back her eyeglasses.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it’s big enough?”</p>

<p>“It is a large size.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’d feel like a Christmas
tree in it?”</p>

<p>“Is he a young man?” asked Millicent.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He’s got a mustache and beard
now,” said Miss Frink, appearing to think
aloud as she caressed the satin musingly. “Of
course that makes him look older, and his
beard is quite red. Much redder than his hair
and, of course, <em>crimson</em>—but that will be off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in a few days—” She paused, continuing to
consider, and Millicent’s soothing voice fell
upon her perturbed thought.</p>

<p>“You see the lining is very nice. They have
taken that dark tint in the flowers and matched
it, so there is nothing too gay about it, I should
think.”</p>

<p>Her hazel eyes met Miss Frink’s and her
smile was winning. “Of course, you know best,
but it seems to me this is a dressing-gown for
Prince Charming.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink grimaced her eyeglasses off.</p>

<p>“For whom did you say?” quickly.</p>

<p>Millicent blushed. Miss Frink liked to see
her do it.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just nonsense, but you know, the
hero of all the fairy tales?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know one of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, Prince Charming is always the hero,”
laughed Millicent. Miss Frink in her present
torn mental condition was not frightening. “I
think this dressing-gown looks good enough for
him.”</p>

<p>“Very well.” Miss Frink took a long breath
and replaced her glasses. “I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish it sent?” Millicent was again
the demure saleslady.</p>

<p>“No. Just wrap it up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are mules that go with it,” suggested
the girl. She turned back to the drawer and
brought out the glinting satin slippers.</p>

<p>The corners of Miss Frink’s lips drew down.
“What fool things for a man!” she remarked.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” said Millicent, perceiving
that the customer wished urging. “They’re
very comfortable, and when he wears the gown
he must have some sort of slippers.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink started. “I don’t believe he has
any,” she mused. “Put them in,” she added,
and sighed again.</p>

<p>“You’re a very good saleswoman,” she said
at last. “Probably hungry this minute. I
am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s no matter for me. Did—” the
girl paused, the box in her hand. “Did you
want the price marks taken off?”</p>

<p>“Well, well! You have got more than human
intelligence. Of course I do. How much are
they, by the way?”</p>

<p>Millicent said nothing, for her customer
seized the articles and examined the marks.</p>

<p>“Well”—straightening up—“Prince Charming
thinks pretty well of himself, doesn’t he?
All right, let the hide go with the hoofs, put
the mules in.”</p>

<p>While the box was being wrapped, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Frink looked so closely at Millicent that her
ready color came again.</p>

<p>“What did Ramsay say your name was?”</p>

<p>“Duane. Millicent Duane.”</p>

<p>“I never have time to beat about the bush.
How would you like to come and read to me an
hour every day? I’ve lost my reader and I like
your voice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Frink”—the girl’s hands clasped
together unconsciously. “I know Damaris.
She was so sorry to have offended you. Her
hair will grow again very soon—”</p>

<p>“Well, her common sense won’t,” returned
Miss Frink impatiently. “When a thing is past
with me it’s past. I have no post mortems.
Think it over, Miss Duane.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t afford to lose my job, Miss
Frink,” said the girl with soft eagerness. “They
would never let me go for an hour a day, and
my grandfather has just a small pension; we
have to be very careful.”</p>

<p>That voice. That wholesome face. That
delicately clean shining hair. Miss Frink smiled
a little at the ingenuous lack of consciousness
of the power of money.</p>

<p>“That would be my care,” she said. “Think
it over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, I should like it,” said Millicent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
still with eagerness, “if it was right for me.
It would give me so much more time with
Grandpa. But there is Damaris! I can’t bear
to think of hurting her feelings.”</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense,” said Miss Frink.
“Business is business. You’ll hear from me
again.”</p>

<p>A boy was called to carry the box and the
purchaser departed leaving Millicent flushed,
and happy, and apprehensive.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A TELEGRAM</span></h2>

<p>As Miss Frink was leaving the store the floorwalker
intercepted her. He had in his hands a
letter.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you can throw any light on this,
Miss Frink. A letter that came several days ago
to Mr. Hugh Stanwood in care of the store. We
have no employee of that—”</p>

<p>“No, but you will have,” interrupted Miss
Frink, almost snatching the letter. “Hugh
Stanwood is the man who hindered the rendezvous
my horses were trying to keep with that
express train a few weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so. The young hero who put
us all under such obligation?”</p>

<p>“Me, anyway. I’m in no hurry to play the
harp. Yes, he was on his way to Ross Graham’s
when he stubbed his toe, poor boy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ramsay bowed. “I’ve heard that you
are caring for him royally. I’m sure we shall be
very glad to welcome him into our ranks if it is
your wish.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll let him catch his breath first,
anyway. He’s doing well and, believe me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
couldn’t sleep nights if he wasn’t. I’ve just been
getting him a dressing-gown; you don’t sell
dressing-gowns for your health here, do you?”</p>

<p>The floorwalker smiled deferentially. “Do
you find us exorbitant?”</p>

<p>“Do I! I’ll have to pay for this on the installment
plan.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Very good. Very good, indeed.
Glad we had something that pleased you.
Good-afternoon, Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>On the way home the lady gazed at the letter
she was carrying.</p>

<p>“John Ogden has beat me to it,” she reflected.
At certain moments the lady of the old
school found a relief to her feelings in slang.
“Saber cuts of Saxon speech,” Mark Twain
called it, and Miss Frink liked saber cuts. She
hadn’t time to beat about the bush.</p>

<p>Leaving her box below stairs where her secretary
and Mrs. Lumbard could if they wished
whet their curiosity on its shape and the Ross-Graham
label, she went in to lunch with her
bonnet on.</p>

<p>The others of her family dutifully took their
places. Adèle’s ivory tints were somewhat
flushed. She knew from Miss Damon that she
had scored a triumph with her invisible audience,
and it was a certainty that that meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
credit with Miss Frink. She cast an occasional
unforgiving glance at the secretary who kept to
his usual safe programme of speaking when he
was spoken to.</p>

<p>Miss Frink addressed him now. “Here is a
letter from John Ogden to our patient,” she said.</p>

<p>Adèle’s brown eyes suddenly glanced up,
startled. Still, there were probably hundreds
of John Ogdens in the world.</p>

<p>“Yes. I do feel mortified not to have written
him as soon as I received his letter of introduction.
He will think I’m a savage when he learns
why he hasn’t heard from his young friend.”
The speaker regarded the letter beside her
plate. “He addressed it in care of the store.
Mr. Stanwood was headed for Ross Graham’s,
you know; and they had no more idea <em>there</em> who
Hugh Stanwood was than the man in the
moon.”</p>

<p>“That is a little embarrassing,” returned
Grimshaw circumspectly. “Is there anything I
can do about it?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Miss Frink good-naturedly,
“since you didn’t stand over me and make me
answer that letter.”</p>

<p>“You never showed me the letter of introduction,”
said the secretary, “or I might have
ventured—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, you would have ventured,” returned
Miss Frink, “though I don’t think, Grim,
that your slogan is ‘Nothing venture, nothing
have.’”</p>

<p>“My duty is to protect you, dear lady,”
declared Leonard, unsmiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that, and you’re a good boy,”
said Miss Frink carelessly. She set down her
tea-cup. “Well, I’ll go upstairs and take my
medicine. I hope both the boy and Mr. Ogden
will forgive me. Will you both excuse me,
please?”</p>

<p>She left the room. Adèle longed to comment
on the interesting-looking box she had passed in
the hall, but she was still too angry with Grimshaw
to address him.</p>

<p>“Miss Frink is in remarkably good spirits,”
he observed; and because Adèle knew she could
irritate him, she responded:</p>

<p>“Yes. She must have succeeded in finding
something very fine for her protégé.”</p>

<p>“It is going rather far to call that young
person her protégé,” said the secretary stiffly.</p>

<p>Adèle shrugged her shoulders. “Personally I
think it is a mild name for him.”</p>

<p>“She will give him the employment he seeks,
doubtless, when he is about again,” remarked
Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Unless she just passes over half her kingdom
to him,” said Adèle. “You have been
seeing him. Is he really such a beauty as he
seemed that first day?”</p>

<p>“Remarkable,” answered the secretary dryly,
“with a flaming red beard and mustache.”</p>

<p>“Horrors!” ejaculated Adèle. Then: “Poor
thing, I suppose he couldn’t be shaved.”</p>

<p>The secretary pushed his chair back from the
table. “Only a most common person could
have demanded the music you played for
him.”</p>

<p>Adèle grimaced. “Go on. I know what you
want to say—And only the commonest sort of
person could have played it. Go on. Have
courage, the courage of your convictions.”</p>

<p>“I think Miss Frink will be the best person
to comment on your actions, in this as in all
other matters while you are a guest in her
house.”</p>

<p>The two exchanged a dueling glance. Again
Adèle experienced that fear of her antagonist
which she sometimes experienced. She didn’t
dare to allow him to dislike her.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use, Leonard,” she said with
a sudden change of tone and manner, and she
held out her hand.</p>

<p>He drew back. “Persons shake hands when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they are about to fight,” he said. “I hope there
is nothing of that sort in the air.”</p>

<p>Adèle dropped her hand. “I should hope
not,” she returned, trying to hold him with her
soft brown glance; but he was impervious and
left the room.</p>

<p>Miss Frink, armed with her box, went to the
White Room and knocked on the door. As the
nurse opened it, her grave little mouth was
smiling.</p>

<p>“We’ve nearly cured Mr. Stanwood while
you have been gone,” she said cheerfully.
“I’ve heard that music was being used a good
deal now to heal the sick; and here we have an
example.”</p>

<p>Hugh was smiling, too, above his blanket
wrappings. “Some pianist you have here,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you like that?” asked Miss Frink.
“Mrs. Lumbard played, then.”</p>

<p>“By George, it was all I could do to stay in
the chair,” said Hugh.</p>

<p>“Well, now I’m glad to hear that,” said Miss
Frink. “Music is one thing we can give you.
I’m glad you’re in a good mood, too, for I’m
just a little bit more ashamed than I ever
thought I should be again.” She dropped her
box on a chair, and, advancing, held out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
letter. “From Mr. Ogden,” she continued,
“and I don’t know how old it is, and I’m real
sorry I’m too old to blush.” She noted that the
invalid’s hands were enveloped in the blanket.
“Would you like me to read it to you?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no,” returned Hugh hastily,
thrusting out a hand for the letter. “I can
read it all right.”</p>

<p>The caller crossed to a window and sat down;
and as Hugh opened his letter Miss Frink
noticed that he was not too old to blush.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Hugh</span> (he read)</p>

<p>I am nonplussed at not hearing from you. A
little more and I will have to institute a search;
for as you know I left orders for your mail to be
forwarded to me, and a letter has come from your
sister. I am being heroic not to open it, and I
don’t dare forward it until I know surely where
you are. The earth seems to have opened and
swallowed you up. Please send me a wire as soon
as you get this. Yours sincerely</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Ogden</span></p>

</div>

<p>“Say, Miss Frink”—Hugh’s brow was
troubled as he folded the letter. “I ought to
send a wire to Ogden. He has been the best sort
of a friend to me and—and sending me with
that letter of—of introduction to you—he
can’t understand not hearing from me—whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
I got the job or—or anything you—you
understand.”</p>

<p>Long before the stammering speech was over,
Miss Frink was beside Hugh’s chair. “Don’t
you worry another minute,” she said. “I’ll
send a wire at once explaining everything, and
Mr. Ogden will know I am the only villain in
the plot.”</p>

<p>“Plot,” thought Hugh, his heart beating
with repugnance to the situation.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door. It was a
maid announcing the barber. “Oh, yes, Miss
Frink,” said Miss Damon. “While you were
gone Dr. Morton called up and said he was
sending the barber.”</p>

<p>“Let him come up,” said Miss Frink, “and
don’t let him cut your head off, boy, because I
want you to hear the telegram I’ll be sending
John Ogden.”</p>

<p>She proceeded downstairs to her study and
dashed in with the novel excitability she had
displayed ever since the runaway. The shell-rimmed
spectacles glanced up and the secretary
rose. His dignity of manner was exceptional
to-day.</p>

<p>“Grim, I wish to send a wire. I don’t want to
send it over the phone nor by a servant. I want
you please to take it down for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The secretary inclined his head in silence.</p>

<p>An hour later John Ogden in his office read
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Have been very remiss not to tell you that your
friend Mr. Stanwood on day of arrival stopped
my runaway, saved my life, broke his arm and
head, very ill for a time at my house. Doing well
now. If you wish to come to see him happy to
entertain you long as you can stay. He called
constantly in delirium for Aunt Sukey, but will
not let me send for her. Advise me and forgive
my carelessness.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Susanna Frink</span></p>

</div>

<p>John Ogden stared at this communication for
a full minute with an incredulous gaze before he
emitted a peal of laughter that brought tears to
his eyes, and an office boy from the next room.</p>

<p>He sent a prompt reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Thank you. Will be with you next Thursday.</p>

</div>

<p>When Miss Frink returned to the White
Room, she found the invalid transformed from
the rôle of Faust, to that of some famous movie
hero of the present day. He was in bed again
too tired and worried to smile at her.</p>

<p>“I guess a nap will be the next thing, Miss
Frink, and then perhaps Mrs. Lumbard will
give us some more music,” said Miss Damon.</p>

<p>“Very well,” returned the lady briskly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
“Here’s what I sent to Ogden.” She stood by
the bedside and read the telegram. At the
mention of Aunt Sukey, Hugh started to laugh.
He was afraid to let himself go. He felt capable
of a fit of schoolgirl hysterics.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Miss Frink stoutly; “it shall
be just as Mr. Ogden says, not as you say,
about sending for her. I know you, and your
modesty about making trouble. Next time he
gets up, Miss Damon, put this on your patient.”
Miss Frink opened the waiting box and took
out her gorgeous gift. She unfolded it before
Hugh’s dazzled eyes, and Miss Damon exclaimed
her admiration.</p>

<p>“You see Ross Graham isn’t such a country
store, Mr. Stanwood,” declared Miss Frink.</p>

<p>Hugh whistled. “You called me modest,” he
said. “Is it your idea that I shall ever wear
that?”</p>

<p>“The clerk called it a dressing-gown for
Prince Charming,” said Miss Frink triumphantly,
“and here are the slippers, Mr. Stanwood.
Of course, they’ll fit you because they
haven’t any heels. I think the girl said they
were called donkeys.”</p>

<p>“Queer,” remarked Hugh, “when donkey’s
heels are their long suit.” But because his
hostess was holding the satin near his hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
evidently wished it, he felt the rich fabric admiringly,
again wishing himself back in that
familiar basement, packing boxes, honestly.</p>

<p>“So music means a great deal to you, Mr.
Stanwood,” said Miss Frink, regarding the
patient thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that Mr. Stanwood from you,”
he returned restlessly. “Hugh is my name, and
I’d like you to use it.”</p>

<p>“Of course I shall, then, boy,” returned his
hostess promptly. “You like music, Hugh?”</p>

<p>“Well,” put in the nurse with a little laugh,
“if you had seen his eyes when Mrs. Lumbard
was playing!”</p>

<p>“H’m,” grunted Miss Frink. “Well, that’s
easy. Now go to sleep, Prince Charming, and
later this afternoon you shall have another
concert.”</p>

<p>Hugh stifled a groan and held out his pale
right hand. “You know I thank you, Miss
Frink, for all your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Ho,” returned that lady, taking the hand
in her dry grasp, and quickly dropping it. “If
I should begin thanking <em>you</em>, when do you
suppose I should stop talking?”</p>

<p>She swept out of the room and Hugh closed
his eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NEW READER</span></h2>

<p>The Queen of Farrandale had long passed the
time for waiting patiently for anything she
wished for, so it was the very next day that
Millicent Duane came to the big house for a
trial reading.</p>

<p>She gave such perfect satisfaction that it
was scarcely five minutes after she began that
a delicate snore began to proceed from Miss
Frink’s slender nose. Millicent regarded the
recumbent figure in some embarrassment, and
stopped reading.</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s eyes opened at once. “Well,
well, child, what are you waiting for?” she
asked testily. “Got a big word?”</p>

<p>Millicent, crimsoning to the tips of her ears,
began again to read. She was afraid to stop,
although the snoring began again almost immediately,
and read on and on in the novel of
the day. Although Miss Frink was a lady of the
old school, she proposed to know what was
going on in the world at the present time, and
she always bought the book which received the
best reviews, though Millicent came to wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
how she made anything of it in the hashed
condition in which it penetrated her consciousness.</p>

<p>At last, when the lady was positively fast
asleep, Millicent closed the book, took her hat
and wrap in her hand, and went noiselessly out
into the hall and down the stairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard met her at the foot, and the
young girl accosted her.</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Lumbard, isn’t it?” she said
shyly. “I am Millicent Duane. Miss Frink
didn’t tell me what to do if she went to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“You guessed right,” returned the other.
“There is nothing to do but leave her until she
has her nap out. You have evidently qualified.”
Mrs. Lumbard laughed; it was not a
pleasant laugh Millicent thought. “I tried to
read to her, but she wouldn’t have me. Won’t
you sit down a minute, or are you too busy?”</p>

<p>Millicent hesitated, but seated herself near
the other in the spacious hall with its broad
fireplace. “I am not busy at all,” she said,
“and it seems so strange after being a whole
year in the store.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean the Ross-Graham
establishment. That is <em>the</em> store in Farrandale,
is it not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and I suppose it is the finest
one anywhere,” returned Millicent seriously.</p>

<p>Adèle gazed upon her earnest face with its
youthful color and nimbus of blonde hair.</p>

<p>“Have you known Miss Frink long?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we all know her by sight, but I never
spoke to her until yesterday when she came in
to buy a dressing-gown, and I happened that
day to have been put on the dressing-gowns.
Wasn’t I lucky?—for this came of it.”</p>

<p>Millicent’s happy smile revealed a dimple.
Mrs. Lumbard’s eyes scrutinized her.</p>

<p>“I’ll warrant she bought a handsome one,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, gorgeous. The handsomest one we had.
I told her it was fit for Prince Charming.” The
young girl gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, one would do that for the man who
had saved one’s life,” remarked Adèle.</p>

<p>The guest’s lips formed a round O. “Does he
still live here?” she asked, “and is he getting
well?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard shrugged her shoulders. “I
hear so, but I’ve never seen him.”</p>

<p>Millicent looked about her in some awe. “I
suppose in such a great place as this, people
might not meet for days. Grandfather and I
live in a little cubby-house”—the admiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
eyes came back to Mrs. Lumbard’s brown,
curious stare—“but it has a big yard and we
love it.”</p>

<p>The older woman leaned back and shrugged
her shoulders again. At this juncture Miss
Frink appeared on the stairs.</p>

<p>Millicent saw her, and, springing up, met her
where the brass jardinières filled with ferns grew
at the foot of the wide descent.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what to do about leaving,
Miss Frink. I saw you were resting so well.”</p>

<p>The hostess, with a sharp glance at Adèle’s
luxurious posture, laid a kind hand on the girl’s
shoulder as she returned the sweet, eager look.</p>

<p>“You did quite right,” she replied. “Leave
me when you see I am dead to the world, and
then—you may go right home.”</p>

<p>“Right home,” repeated the girl, a little
falteringly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miss Frink pleasantly. “When
you leave me, go right home. You read well.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Millicent. “I hadn’t
thought to ask you. Good-afternoon, Miss
Frink. Good-afternoon, Mrs. Lumbard.”</p>

<p>Her cheeks were hot as she hurried into her
hat and jacket and out the door. When she
reached home, her heart was still quickening
with a vague sense of having done wrong. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
pretty white-haired lady’s eyes and laugh were
curious and cold. Miss Frink had been displeased
that she had stayed and talked with
her. Perhaps she ought not to have told about
the dressing-gown.</p>

<p>Old Colonel Duane was bending his white
head and smooth-shaven face over the little
green sprouts in a garden plot when his granddaughter
flung open the gate and rushed to
him.</p>

<p>He raised himself slowly and looked around
at her flushed cheeks. She pushed her hand
through his arm and clutched it.</p>

<p>“Well, how did you get along, Milly? Does
it beat fitting on gloves?”</p>

<p>“I’m so mortified, Grandpa,” was the rather
breathless reply. “I had to be sent home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, now! You can stay home if
that’s the case. Is Miss Frink an old pepper-pot
as folks say?”</p>

<p>“No, no; she was kind to me, and I read her
to sleep, which is what she wants; but I wasn’t
sure what to do then, so when I met Mrs.
Lumbard in the reception hall downstairs she
asked me to sit down and I did. You remember
my telling you about the white-haired lady
who looks like a beauty of the French Court
with big brown eyes? Well—there’s something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
queer—I don’t like her—and you know
the Prince Charming dressing-gown I told you
Miss Frink bought of me? Well, I told Mrs.
Lumbard about it and she hadn’t known it.”
Big tears began to form and run down the girl’s
cheeks. “You know how we tell each other
everything and show each other everything?
Well, <em>they</em> don’t, for she didn’t know it, and she
said it was for that man who stopped the runaway,
and he’s still there and she has never
seen him, and—and Miss Frink suddenly
came downstairs, and said hereafter I was to go
right home when I left her. Oh”—Millicent
raised her handkerchief to her burning cheek—“very
pleasantly she said it, but what will she
think when she hears that I told about the
dressing-gown? She’ll think I’m a common
gossipy girl.” The tears flowed fast. “It’s
worse than Damaris bobbing her hair. Perhaps
I’ll get word to-morrow morning not to come,
and I’ve given up Ross Graham’s—” The
speaker’s voice encountered a large obstruction
in her throat and stopped suddenly, while she
mopped her eyes.</p>

<p>Her grandfather patted the hand clutching
his arm and gave a comforting little laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill,
child. I judge Miss Frink doesn’t care much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
for the French beauty. She didn’t like finding
you together.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it might be that? Why, she is
her niece.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ve heard of such phenomena as
lack of devotion between aunt and—grand-niece,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I believe so, but how funny that
you know, Grandpa!” Millicent sniffed and
mopped.</p>

<p>“What I don’t know about what goes on in
Farrandale has never been known by anybody.
I’m an easy mark for every one who has anything
to tell. Always doddering around the
house or the estate,” waving his hand about
the fifty feet of yard, “if people can’t find anybody
else to unburden themselves to, there is
always old Silas Duane.”</p>

<p>“You’re so charming, Grandpa,” exclaimed
the girl, clasping his arm tighter than before
and trying to check her tears, “that’s why they
come; and if you told <em>me</em> everything you hear,
I shouldn’t be such a greenie and lose my
job.”</p>

<p>“You won’t lose your job. You succeeded,
and that’s what Miss Frink wants. No failures
need apply.”</p>

<p>“But, Grandpa”—Millicent swallowed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
sob—“did you know that the man, the hero,
was still at Miss Frink’s?”</p>

<p>“Surely I did. Leonard Grimshaw was here
day before yesterday. He has troubles of his
own.” Colonel Duane laughed.</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Grimshaw confide in you?”
Millicent asked it with some awe. “Now I
know that you don’t tell me <em>anything</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so long as I always have the rent
ready, Grimshaw is quite talkative. This Mr.
Stanwood is somewhat of a thorn in his flesh
evidently. He says it is because a sick person
in the house upsets everything, and it is a
nervous strain on Miss Frink; but I imagine her
personal interest in the young man is a little
disturbing.”</p>

<p>“Is he a young man?”</p>

<p>“Yes; according to Grimshaw a young nobody
from nowhere, who was on his way to
look for a job at Ross Graham’s.”</p>

<p>Millicent’s pretty eyes, apparently none the
worse for their salt bath, looked reflective. “He
may have <em>been</em> a nobody, but any one who Miss
Frink believes saved her life becomes somebody
right away.” The girl paused. “I see now why
she seemed pleased to have me say it was fit for
Prince Charming. Oh, that hateful old dressing-gown!
If only Mrs. Lumbard didn’t say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
anything to Miss Frink about it after I came
away! Grandpa, I can’t bear to do that the
first thing.”</p>

<p>The girl buried her eyes against the arm she
was holding. “Miss Frink doesn’t know that I
didn’t know she had a young man in her house,
and I calling him Prince Charming. Mrs. Lumbard
has never seen him. Miss Frink doesn’t
know that I have a grandfather who never tells
me anything when I tell him every thing.”</p>

<p>Colonel Duane smiled and patted her. “Just
go on telling me everything, and don’t tell it to
anybody else. You laugh at me when you catch
me talking to myself; but I’m like that man
who had the same habit, and said he did it
because he liked to talk to a sensible man, and
liked to hear a sensible man talk.”</p>

<p>Then, as Millicent did not lift her head, he
went on. “I’ll give you another quotation: a
comforting one. It was our own Mr. Emerson
who said: ‘Don’t talk. What you are thunders
so loud above what you say, that I can’t hear
you.’ Now, Miss Frink is, I suppose, as shrewd
a woman as ever lived; and something that you
<em>are</em> has thundered so loud above all that dressing-gown
business that you needn’t lose any
sleep to-night or quake in your little shoes to-morrow
when you go back to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent breathed a long sigh and straightened
up.</p>

<p>“Then I think I’ll go in and make a salad for
supper,” she replied. “It’s such fun to have
time—and it—it seems so ungrateful—”</p>

<p>“Tut-tut,” warned her grandfather; and just
then Damaris came in at the gate.</p>

<p>“I heard you began reading to her to-day,”
she said eagerly and without preface. “You
look sort of pale. Did she scare you to
death?”</p>

<p>“No. She went right to sleep. How could
you hear about it, Damaris? I was coming to
tell you.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Morton had to come to see Mother, and
he told us. He told us all about that Mr. Stanwood,
too. He’s nearly well. Dr. Morton says
he’s so handsome all the girls in town will mob
him; and there you will be right on the inside.
Some people’s luck!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t—I don’t want to see him,” said
Millicent, so genuinely aghast that the girl
with the bobbed hair laughed.</p>

<p>“Why, perhaps you’ll see that dressing-gown.
He must have been the one she was buying
it for.”</p>

<p>“Damaris, did I tell you about that dressing-gown?”
The girl’s tone was tragic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, of course—you were telling me only
last night the way you met Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>Millicent caught her breath. “Never speak
of it again, Damaris.”</p>

<p>“How exciting!” The flapper’s eyes sparkled.
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Nothing at all.” Millicent’s
usual serenity had entirely vanished. “It’s
dangerous to have to do with powerful people,
that’s all. I was so safe in the glove section and
my customers liked me”—another sob caught
in the speaker’s throat. “Everything is your
fault, Grandpa, if your eyes hadn’t been injured
in the Cuban War I shouldn’t have begun to
read aloud when I was knee-high to a grasshopper
and I shouldn’t read so well—and you
never tell me anything, and—Damaris, I lay
awake last night thinking that if I did leave the
gloves, you ought to have my place. What
could we do with your hair!”</p>

<p>Damaris shook it ruefully.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in the house and see what we can
do with ribbons and an invisible net—and I’ll
ask Miss Frink—if I ever see her again.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">JOHN OGDEN ARRIVES</span></h2>

<p>As the heavy door closed behind Millicent,
Mrs. Lumbard straightened up. How could
Miss Frink reasonably criticize her for civility
to the young girl, although the mandate just
expressed revealed an objection? “Disagreeable
old thing!” reflected Adèle, while her face
expressed only deferential attention.</p>

<p>She expected to see her hostess disappear as
usual in the direction of the study; but instead,
Miss Frink, eyeing her steadily, came and took
the chair Millicent had vacated, and began at
once to speak: “The presence of a sick person in
the house throws out the general routine,” she
said. “I have really been very anxious until
now about Mr. Stanwood; but he is coming out
all right and now I can give my mind to your
affairs. You said your idea in coming here was
to get me to help you decide what to do. I presume
you have been studying on your problem.
Have you come to any conclusion?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard blinked under the unexpected
attack, and for a minute could not find the
right words to reply to the entirely impersonal
and businesslike regard bent upon her.</p>

<p>“You are young,” went on Miss Frink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
“You are an expert musician. My house is a
very dull place for you to live.” Adèle wondered
if Leonard had quoted her. “You must
have been revolving some plans in your mind.
I can give my full attention to you now.
Speak on.”</p>

<p>Oh, how hard it was to speak under that cool
gaze; since she could not say, “Yes, this house
is a regular morgue, but my luxurious bed and
your perfect cook reconcile me to staying here.”
There was nothing in Miss Frink’s manner to
suggest that she had any idea that this guest
might make an indefinite stay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard’s face maintained its deferential
look and her voice took the childlike tone
she could use at will. “A spineless tone,” Miss
Frink dubbed it mentally. She rebuked herself
for not liking Adèle, but the latter’s love of idle
luxury “thundered above” her inefficient meekness,
and not all of Susanna’s still green memory
of her Alice could antidote her distaste for
the young woman’s lack of energy.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth,” said Adèle slowly, “it
has been so wonderful to be in a safe, quiet
harbor that I have given up to the refreshment
of it for this little while, and just enjoyed your
sweet hospitality. I think I have been unconsciously
waiting for just such a moment as this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
when your experience and wise thought could
direct me—”</p>

<p>“No, no, child, don’t talk that way. A
woman of your age shouldn’t need directing—”</p>

<p>Miss Frink paused, for a servant entered the
hall, and went past them to the door.</p>

<p>As he opened it John Ogden entered, a suitcase
in his hand. At sight of his hostess he
paused in announcing himself.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Frink,” he exclaimed, as the
servant took the suitcase, “I counted on your
not minding a surprise party, for I found it
was possible to come at once.”</p>

<p>The two women rose, and Adèle saw that
the mistress of the house could be cordial if
she wished to.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Ogden dropped Miss Frink’s
hand when he realized her companion. “Why,
Mrs. Reece,” he said, in a changed tone, “what
a surprise to find you here—away from your
sunny South,” he added hastily, fearing his
amazement betrayed more than he wished.</p>

<p>Adèle, coloring to the tips of her ears, shook
hands with him and murmured something
which Miss Frink’s brusque tone interrupted.</p>

<p>“Stebbins,” she said to the servant, “Mr.
Ogden will have the green room. Show him to
it, and when he is ready take him to Mr. Stanwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
at once. Mr. Ogden, you are more than
welcome, and I know you will do Mr. Stanwood
a world of good. I will see you a little
later.”</p>

<p>When the guest had vanished up the stairs,
Miss Frink resumed her seat and her companion
sank into hers, as pale as she had been scarlet.</p>

<p>“I suppose you can explain,” said Miss
Frink.</p>

<p>“Mr.—Mr. Ogden never met me after my
second marriage,” said Adèle faintly.</p>

<p>“The first one died, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know why you are so rough,
Aunt Susanna.” Adèle was evidently controlling
tears.</p>

<p>“Well, you know how I feel. I like the sod
kind better than grass. Never mind my bluntness,
child. That’s neither here nor there. Mr.
Reece left you something?”</p>

<p>“His life insurance, yes.”</p>

<p>“Then it was all gone, I suppose, when you
decided to try again, and drew a blank in the
matrimonial market.”</p>

<p>“Yes—almost,” faltered Adèle.</p>

<p>“Then, did the unpleasant ceremony you
were forced to go through afterward result in
your getting any alimony?”</p>

<p>“A—a very little.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Frink’s lips twitched in her peculiar
smile. “And you still had some life insurance
from number one. You’re a fast worker, Adèle.”</p>

<p>At this the tears came.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t cry,” said Miss Frink impatiently.
“You can do that later. I was wondering
if you would care for a position in Ross
Graham’s. I took Miss Duane away from the
gloves, and I told them not to fill the place at
once.”</p>

<p>The young widow’s angry breath caught in
her throat, but she stammered meekly:</p>

<p>“And go on—living here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you wouldn’t be willing to do that,
would you?” said Miss Frink reasonably.</p>

<p>“Would you want Miss Frink’s niece to be
selling gloves in her store?”</p>

<p>“Ho!” exclaimed the other with a short
laugh. “Miss Frink herself sold candy and
cake and waited on table and was glad when
she got a tip, and everybody in town knows it.”</p>

<p>Adèle’s cheeks burned again. “It would be
foolish not to utilize my music,” she said.
“Since you have no pride in the matter, no
doubt there are movie theaters in Farrandale,
and I can perhaps play in one.”</p>

<p>The young woman got the reaction she was
trying for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, you can’t,” returned Miss Frink
promptly. “That’s where I draw the line. Let
the men do that.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard rose. “Please excuse me,”
she said faintly. It was the psychological
moment. She had put Miss Frink in the wrong.
Let her reflect a little. She knew the conscientious
fairness under that rough husk. “I feel
ill, Aunt Susanna,” she faltered. “I should like
to lie down for a while.”</p>

<p>Her handkerchief to her eyes she passed up
the broad staircase, Miss Frink looking after
her, and feeling baffled.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’d like to lie down the rest of your
life,” she declared mentally. It was too bad
that Alice Ray could not have given the legacy
of her splendid backbone to her descendants.
“It’s tiresome, too,” added Miss Frink to herself.
“I meant her to play to the boy about
now; but I suppose she’s got to snivel just so
long.”</p>

<p>There being no tears behind Mrs. Lumbard’s
handkerchief, she was herself when in the dim
large hall above she met Mr. Ogden and the
butler coming out of the green room.</p>

<p>“You can go,” she said hurriedly to the latter.
“Mr. Ogden and I are old friends, Stebbins. I
will show him Mr. Stanwood’s room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The man bowed and departed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden, I’m not Mrs. Reece—that is,
you know, not any more.” She gave a nervous
little laugh. “I’m—I’m Mrs. Lumbard now.”</p>

<p>Ogden bowed. “I’ll remember. Such matters
are very quickly arranged, these days. I’m
sorry not to have been up-to-date.”</p>

<p>She forced another little laugh at this.</p>

<p>“You know Aunt Susanna is a lady of the
old school and she detests—er—second marriages,
and things like that—divorces and
everything. You understand.”</p>

<p>“Your aunt!” exclaimed Ogden in amazement.
“Well, I am indeed ’way, ’way behind
the times. I had no idea Miss Frink had a niece
and, and—”</p>

<p>“Least of all, me, I suppose,” put in Adèle,
laughing again.</p>

<p>“Your little girl, is she here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind about the baby either,
Mr. Ogden, please. You see, Aunt Susanna is so
peculiar, and we’ve always been strangers. I
haven’t even told her about the baby. I didn’t
want to annoy her by bringing a child here.
Just don’t know anything, please, except that
I’m Mrs. Lumbard now, and you met me in
Atlanta, and never say a word about what I
was doing, because she would faint away at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
mention of the stage, and I don’t want to offend
her.”</p>

<p>“I understand perfectly.” Ogden bowed
gravely. He thought he did.</p>

<p>At this moment Leonard Grimshaw, always
silent-footed as a cat, appeared in the dimness
of the hall, coming from his room. Adèle had no
means of knowing whether he had heard any of
their talk, but was alertly conscious that he
must notice the intimacy of their position as
they stood conversing in hushed tones like a
pair of conspirators.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Mr. Grimshaw,” she said lightly.
“Perhaps you know—”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do,” said Ogden, and the two
men approached and shook hands.</p>

<p>“We expected you Thursday,” said the secretary,
with a formal bow.</p>

<p>“And I hope Miss Frink will forgive my impatience.
She says she will.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden and I were so surprised to see
each other,” said Adèle. “We met in Atlanta
through our interest in music. You came in the
nick of time, Leonard. Stebbins was just going
to take Mr. Ogden to Mr. Stanwood’s room
and I intercepted him. Now you will do it.”</p>

<p>The secretary bowed again. “If that is Miss
Frink’s wish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Both Miss Frink’s and mine,” said Ogden
pleasantly. “I understand the boy has provided
a good deal of excitement in this corner of
the world.”</p>

<p>“One can’t help being ill,” said Grimshaw
stiffly, “but it is astonishing how that sort of
thing permeates a house and changes its routine.”</p>

<p>Ogden’s fist doubled as he followed his guide,
but he made no reply. The secretary as usual
forgot to knock at the door of the White Room,
and throwing open the door ushered in the
guest.</p>

<p>Miss Damon had gone downstairs, and there
sat the convalescent in the big chair by the
window. Ogden gasped. The secretary stared.</p>

<p>Freshly shaved, the rich folds of the dressing-gown
about him, his feet in the glinting mules
on the footrest, his handsome head leaning
against the white upholstery of the armchair,
he formed a picture which filled one of his
guests with enthusiasm, and the other with
fury.</p>

<p>“Is this the Rajah of Nankagorah!” cried
Ogden.</p>

<p>Hugh’s heart leaped with a combination of
joy and rage. It was ages since he had seen a soul
who knew him, and here was the reason. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
wanted to hug him. He wanted to choke him.</p>

<p>He kicked away the stool, pulled himself to
his feet and showed his teeth in a snarling sort
of smile. “Damn you, Ogden!” he said.</p>

<p>John Ogden laughed and, striding forward,
threw an arm around the satin-clad shoulders.</p>

<p>“Which is the safe hand? Which arm was
it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“They’re both safe to do for you one of these
days,” returned Hugh, clutching his friend.</p>

<p>The secretary waited for no more. The
apparition of Miss Frink’s extravagance and
its stunning effect roused a fever of resentment
in him. He went out and closed the door. He
continued to stand outside it for a minute, but
the old house was well built and the voices
within were low. He moved away and downstairs,
and was just in time to see Miss Frink
going out the front door, attired in wrap and
hat.</p>

<p>“Dear lady, aren’t you coming into the
study?”</p>

<p>“Some time,” she replied lightly. “I made a
purchase by ’phone this morning and I want to
look at it before it is sent up. Have you seen
Mr. Ogden?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve just taken him to Mr. Stanwood’s
room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose the boy was delighted to see
him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He swore like a trooper,”
replied the secretary with a righteous, long-suffering
lift of his crest.</p>

<p>The lady of the old school looked pensive,
and smiled.</p>

<p>“Can the boy swear? What a naughty boy!”
she said. “I imagine he looks handsomer than
ever when he is excited.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw’s full lips tightened as he escorted
her out to the carriage.</p>

<p>“Breaking. Breaking fast,” he thought, and
he made up his mind to be on the lookout for
the bill for that dressing-gown. As a matter of
fact, he never did see it. In some way Miss
Frink managed to extract that from the usual
routine.</p>

<p>“What is she up to now?” he muttered,
watching the spirited bays jingling up the
street at the pace they took when their owner
was in a hurry. An awful certainty possessed
him that the occupant of the White Room—the
resplendent young Rajah who looked handsome
when he swore—had something to do
with their celerity.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">A MUTINOUS ACTOR</span></h2>

<p>John Ogden waited long enough to shake his
fist toward the closed door before he turned
back to regard Hugh, who, with features refined
by illness, perfectly groomed, and grandly arrayed,
seemed to him a new person. The gloomy
expression in the eyes, however, warned him.</p>

<p>“Sit down again, Hugh,” he forced the tall
fellow back into the white easy-chair, “and let
me speak first.”</p>

<p>Hugh sat down perforce, but with a belligerent
expression. “No, sir. I’m going to do all
the speaking,” he said. “You got me into this
and you’ve got to get me out.”</p>

<p>“Now, now, boy”—Ogden drew the nearest
chair forward and dropped into it. “I
expected I might find you a bit morbid—”</p>

<p>“Morbid!” explosively. “Me with a nurse!
Me being stuffed four times a day with the
delicacies of the season! Me dressed up like a
Christmas doll! I don’t need anything but a
wrap of tissue paper and a sprig of holly to be
ready for delivery; and me a liar all the
time—”</p>

<p>“Look here, Hugh”—John Ogden faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the indignation in the dark eyes. “Did you
notice my escort as I came in? And is he on
such intimate terms with you that he bolts into
your room without ceremony?”</p>

<p>“We’re on no terms at all. I despise the
little cockatoo and he hates me—”</p>

<p>“He has reason,” put in Ogden with a nod.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know why. I haven’t done anything
to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you have.” John Ogden spoke
slowly.</p>

<p>“What, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“You’ve delayed the settling of the estate—unwarrantably,
and—indefinitely.”</p>

<p>Hugh stared, and then broke forth hotly.
“Oh, look here, that’s a darned mean thing to
say!”</p>

<p>“I think he’s a darned mean little man,”
returned Ogden calmly. “Now we’ve got to
look this ground all over, if I’m to get you out
of here. How comes on Sukey the Freak?”</p>

<p>Hugh’s face flushed. “She’s a wonder, and a
sport,” he answered. “If she wasn’t so infernally
grateful to me for breaking my arm, she’d
be all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think the Queen of Farrandale likes
her job pretty well. You probably did help her
to keep it, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’m sick of hearing about it,” said
Hugh restlessly, “and if she knew who I am I
could stand all this pampering better; but it’s
degrading to be waited on, and stuffed, and
having to accept presents when—when I’m
deceiving her; and I warn you”—he began
speaking faster—“I’m not going to stand it,
and I just waited to see you. Miss Damon, the
nurse, is a good scout, but I hate the sight of
her. I want to be let alone. My arm is all
right”—he moved it about—“a little weak,
but here’s my right all the time.”</p>

<p>“But you went off your head, my dear boy,
and shouted for Aunt Sukey till you brought
tears from a bronze image.” Ogden didn’t dare
to laugh. “It rests with me to bring her here
right now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you think that’s very funny, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“I think that such a début as you made in
the rôle I planned for you was little short of
miraculous; and to give it up and leave it would
be flying in the face of Providence.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whose face I fly in. I’m strong
enough to move out of here, and I’m going.”</p>

<p>Ogden regarded him thoughtfully from the
thatch of auburn waves down to his jeweled
satin feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“If a film-producer should come in here now,
you would never be allowed to learn the department-store
business,” he said. “I’ll wager that
Miss Frink is having a romance—rather late
in life, I admit, but it goes all the deeper.”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head gravely. “Don’t make
any fun of her. Whatever she did to my father,
she has been wonderful to me. I’ll be ashamed
to face her when the truth comes out.”</p>

<p>“By that time you won’t, boy. Grimshaw is
so jealous of you that it shows your work is
well begun.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! The meanness of it,” said Hugh
repugnantly. “She is so frank and honest that
it’s disgusting to be plotting against her. Grimshaw
has got it all over me. He’s in his own
cockatoo colors when all’s said and done; but
I”—the speaker lifted a fold of his rich robe
and dropped it with a groan.</p>

<p>“I’m pleased that you like Miss Frink so
much,” said Ogden, ignoring this. “Everything
will come out all right. Everybody
confined to a sick-room gets morbid.” The
speaker looked about the spacious apartment,
and through a door ajar had a glimpse of the
silver and tile of the bathroom. “Isn’t the
house charming?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Hugh curtly. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
know when I once get out of it I’ll never see it
again.”</p>

<p>Ogden smiled. “My actor is more temperamental
than an opera star,” he mused aloud.
“Promise me one thing, boy; I think you owe
me that much. Promise me you won’t take any
step without forewarning me.”</p>

<p>“Of course I owe it to you,” said Hugh bitterly.
“I owe everybody. I’ve been the most
appalling expense both to you and Miss Frink,
it makes me sick to think of it when I don’t
know how I can ever get even.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get even with me by just doing what
I say,” returned the other forcefully. “Of
course, I haven’t seen you and Miss Frink
together yet, but I’m certain you have been
and are being a wonderful event in her life.
She has been the loneliest woman I ever knew
except on her business side. Look at this perfectly
appointed house. I never heard of any
entertaining here, nor even a passing guest. It
took somebody with the nerve to come in and
go right to bed and stay.”</p>

<p>Hugh drew a long breath, and felt that he
should never like John Ogden again. He might
be a ne’er-do-well himself, but at least he had a
sense of honor.</p>

<p>“But, by the way, I found the record broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to-day,” went on Ogden. “I was much surprised
to find Miss Frink had a niece, and that
she is staying here: a Mrs. Reece—or I think
she said it was Lumbard or some such name,
now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall have to divide the fortune with
one person.”</p>

<p>John Ogden laughed cheerfully. The statement
came so tragically from between clenched
teeth. “Have you met her?” he continued.</p>

<p>“No; but I heard her play yesterday. She’s a
wizard, even if she has got white hair as the
nurse told me.”</p>

<p>Ogden gave his head a quick shake. “Don’t
be misled by that white hair. I’ve met her
several times in the South; and she is just about
the last person on earth that I should expect to
turn out to be Miss Frink’s niece. In fact”—the
speaker paused reflectively—“I must say
I can’t help doubting the fact.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I suppose you think she’s an
impostor like me.”</p>

<p>“Not like you, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Any one as strictly honorable as Miss
Frink makes an easy prey,” declared Hugh
severely, “but it would be a little hard to get
away with the false declaration by a woman
that she is her niece.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“A niece more incredible than a nephew, you
think?” said Ogden cheerfully.</p>

<p>This persistent light-heartedness was met
with a scowl.</p>

<p>“You and I can’t hope to look at this matter
alike, Mr. Ogden. You see something amusing
in hoodwinking one of the finest, most
straightforward women who ever lived in the
world—”</p>

<p>“Bully! Bully! Bully!” ejaculated the other.
“Better than I could have hoped. Now, hold
your horses, boy, you’ve proved you know how,
and you’re going to be smiling at me instead of
scowling a little later.”</p>

<p>“She’s killing me with kindness,” burst forth
the convalescent obstreperously. “She means
well; but, thunder, how bored I am!”</p>

<p>“This is the end of it,” replied Ogden.
“We’ll get rid of the nurse. I can stay a few
days and give you what assistance you need,
and in a very short time you will be an independent
citizen and have the run of the house.”</p>

<p>“The run of the house”—scornfully. “Like
a tame cat. I suppose you think I’ll be shut in,
nights.”</p>

<p>A knock on the door was followed by the
entrance of the nurse with a tray whose contents
made John Ogden hungry. Hugh regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it gloomily. The ignominious fact was
that his appetite waxed daily.</p>

<p>“Miss Damon, this is my friend, Mr. Ogden,
come on from New York to get me out of here.”</p>

<p>The nurse smiled and went on deftly arranging
the tray. “He will do that very easily now,
Mr. Stanwood. In fact, I don’t think I’m
needed any longer, and I’ve had a summons
to-day to a very sick woman, and I am hoping
Miss Frink will let me go at once. She seemed
so unwilling for me to leave.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. Yes, yes,” exclaimed her
patient eagerly. “There’s nothing for you to
stay for. It’s utter nonsense. Of course, you
shall leave. I’ll insist upon it.”</p>

<p>“And I can stay a little while,” said Ogden,
“and give Mr. Si—Stanwood any assistance
he needs.”</p>

<p>“Miss Frink is out just now, but I think I’ll
be packing up my things and be all ready when
she comes.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Hugh, and Miss Damon
vanished into a dressing-room.</p>

<p>“You said you had a letter from Carol.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Ogden took it from his pocket.
“Don’t let your broth get cold. The letter has
waited this long. A few minutes more won’t
mean anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, hers are always short. Let me have it.”</p>

<p>Hugh opened the letter and glanced over it
frowningly. “Poor little Carol!” he exclaimed;
then he read aloud to an absorbed listener:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Hugh</span>,</p>

<p>The end has come for Alfred. I am sure you
will not be surprised to hear it. I have known for
months it must come and have braced myself to
bear it. I am glad he always let me know the
inside of his affairs, and, from the time his illness
started, I set myself to learn the business so I
could take his place. Alfred’s partner, Mr. Ferry,
I never wholly liked and trusted. I do not feel
sure of his loyalty, and for the sake of my children
I feel I must guard every step of my business way.
I do not say this to trouble you, or make you feel
you must come to me. You could not help me by
coming, and it is a long, expensive journey. I
promise to tell you if I see any definite cause for
anxiety. Don’t worry about me, dear. I am well
and so are both the children; but let me hear from
you soon.</p>

<p class="center">Your loving sister</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Carol</span></p>

</div>

<p>Hugh looked up. John Ogden’s eyes were
shining.</p>

<p>“There’s only one Carol,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m a nice support for a sister to lean on,”
said Hugh bitterly. “And this letter is two
weeks old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will attend to that with a wire,” said
Ogden.</p>

<p>“You’ll tell her not to write to me, I suppose,”
said Hugh with a sneer.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll tell her to write in my care, as you
are recovering from a slight illness.”</p>

<p>“I told you, in the first place, what Carol
would think of this whole performance.”</p>

<p>“I shall convert her,” declared Ogden. “I
shall write to her to-night. Eat your luncheon,
Hugh, and go on trusting in me.”</p>

<p>“Ho! Trusting!” muttered Hugh.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CONSOLE</span></h2>

<p>John Ogden continued to reassure his protégé,
telling him that he would be right behind him if
there was anything he could do at any time for
Carol, and Hugh was fast clearing the dainty
tray when, replying to a knock at his door,
Miss Frink walked in.</p>

<p>Hugh noticed at once that she was wearing
that triumphant expression which portended
some contribution to his well-being; and, indeed,
she was at once followed by the bearer
of a handsome piece of furniture which proved
to be the latest artistic shape, and most expensive
wood, that can encase a musical machine.</p>

<p>“Music is good for him, Mr. Ogden,” she
explained when the polished beauty was set
against the wall and the man had left. “Hugh
is very fond of music, and I wanted him to be
able to have it whenever he wished, and choose
his own pieces.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Frink!” exclaimed Hugh, not
joyfully, rather with an accent of despair.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” she responded, opening the
door of the record depository. “He doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
want me to get him anything; but for my own
sake I ought to have one of these in the house.”</p>

<p>“That is a corker, Miss Frink,” said Ogden,
coming forward to make an admiring examination
of the Console.</p>

<p>“You pick out something for him,” said
Miss Frink. “Where’s Miss Damon?”</p>

<p>“I’m here.” The nurse appeared from the
dressing-room and removed Hugh’s tray while
Ogden put an opera selection on the machine
and started it to playing.</p>

<p>They all listened in silence to the Pilgrims’
Chorus, and Miss Frink watched Hugh’s face,
noting that none of that stimulation which
the nurse had described as the effect of music
appeared upon it.</p>

<p>“Turn it off,” she said brusquely. “He
doesn’t like that piece. We’ll try another.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I do,” said Hugh when quiet
again reigned. “You make me feel deucedly
ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother to be grateful, boy,” said
Miss Frink imperturbably. “I want you to
have what you like. I let the clerk pick out
these records and they’re here on trial. Back
goes Wagner. Perhaps you’re like the man who
heard ‘Tannhäuser’ and said he thought Wagner
had better have stuck to his sleeping-cars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Miss Frink,” said Miss Damon
in her demure voice. “You have the catalogue
there, and I think, if you would let Mrs. Lumbard
come up and make some selections—she
seems to understand Mr. Stanwood’s taste—”</p>

<p>“Bright thought!” exclaimed Miss Frink.
“Miss Damon, go over to her room and get her,
will you?”</p>

<p>No sooner said than done; and, as soon
as the nurse had disappeared, Hugh spoke:
“Miss Damon has to leave this afternoon,
Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>That lady faced him with a slight frown. “I
don’t know about her having to,” she returned.</p>

<p>“Yes, a very sick woman has sent for her,”
said Hugh. His voice suddenly burst from his
control, “And I can’t stand it any longer!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you didn’t like her.”</p>

<p>“You know I do like her,” returned Hugh
roughly, “but you know I’ve been trying to get
you to let her go for a week.”</p>

<p>“And if you will allow me,” said Ogden,
with his most charming and cheery manner,
“I will stay a few days and chaperon Hugh
over the stairs a few times, enough to give you
confidence—he seems to have it plus—”</p>

<p>Miss Frink gave her rare laugh. “That boy
is a joke, Mr. Ogden. He spends his days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
counting my pennies, I do believe. He sees me
bankrupt. All right, you stay and Miss Damon
shall go.” And here the nurse and Adèle came
into the room.</p>

<p>The latter stared greedily at the object of her
curiosity. Flushed with his recent resentment,
and robed in the small crimson jewels glinting
against their lustrous black background, he sat
there, and she devoured him with her eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stanwood, this is—” began Miss Frink,
when Hugh, pushing on the arms of his throne,
sprang to his feet with a smile of amazement.</p>

<p>“Ally!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Miss Frink stared. Another strange name
for her incubus. She was no more surprised
than the object of Hugh’s laughing recognition.
Mrs. Lumbard gazed at him for a delighted,
puzzled space.</p>

<p>“I do believe you don’t know me. Why
should you?” he cried. “This”—he grasped
his robe—“is a little different from the canteen.”</p>

<p>“Hughie!” exclaimed Adèle, and hurried
forward to take both his hands.</p>

<p>“She made music for us over there, Miss
Frink. I ought to have known it when I heard
her yesterday. Nobody can hit the box quite
like Ally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why do you call her Ally?” Miss Frink
found voice to ask.</p>

<p>“Short for Albino,” laughed Hugh. “Of
course, Ally.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s heart quickened. “In a single
night.” The sad statement recurred to her at
once; but it was characteristic that she postponed
this consideration.</p>

<p>“Here is another chance for you to be useful,
Adèle,” she said. “Take this catalogue over to
Mr. Stanwood and between you make out a
list of his preferences. Give me three numbers
right away.—No, don’t either of you say, ‘Do
you remember,’ until I’ve got those numbers.
I suppose you can find some of the tunes you
had over in France.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want one of them,” said Hugh
emphatically. “Not much. That thing you
played yesterday, Ally.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that will be here, and other selections
from the same opera.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Frink was exchanging words
with Miss Damon, and, as the nurse left to get
into her street dress, Miss Frink went to the
phone and called a number.</p>

<p>“Is this you, Millicent? This is Miss Frink.
Hold the wire. Now, then, Adèle?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard came near with the catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and gave three numbers in turn. These Miss
Frink repeated over the wire. “Have you a
pencil there? All right. You’ve written them?
All right. Now take a cab, please, and get these
records. If you can’t find them one place, go to
another. Have them charged to me, and drive
out here and ask to be shown up to the White
Room.”</p>

<p>She hung up. “You can go on making a
longer list now. Perhaps Mr. Ogden will help
you. Excuse me while I see Miss Damon.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink left the room, and Adèle and
Hugh immediately fell into reminiscence, John
Ogden looking on with an expression not wholly
in keeping with the mirthful chuckles that
accompanied their resurrected jokes.</p>

<p>“And what’s doing now, Ally? Are you a
lady of leisure?” asked Hugh at last.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am visiting Aunt Susanna for a little
while, but I’ve got to go at something to earn
my living. Do you know Farrandale well, Mr.
Ogden?”</p>

<p>“Why—a—pretty well,” returned that
gentleman who had suddenly been galvanized
by seeing that the young woman had unconsciously
picked up a letter lying near her, and
was twisting it nervously in her hands. It was
Hugh’s letter from Carol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think I would have a chance of
getting enough music pupils here to make my
bread and butter, with occasionally a little
jam?” Mrs. Lumbard’s eyes sparkled at the
welcome bit of life that had come her way, and
she felt jubilant that the drudgery of first
moves in an acquaintance had been done away
with in the case of herself and “Hughie.” So
his name was Stanwood. He was one of the
crowd of “Buddies” who doubtless would all
remember her, though her stay at their canteen
had not been long, and only Hugh’s exceptional
looks had marked him out for her
remembrance. She hoped his pleasure at seeing
her and his enjoyment of her music would
weigh in her favor with the difficult relative she
had stormed but not conquered. That awful
break about her hair! How would she get over
that?</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it is a flourishing little town,”
returned Ogden, coming nearer, with hungry
eyes on the letter. “If there was some way to
give them a chance to hear you play.”</p>

<p>Here Miss Frink returned, and Hugh accosted her.</p>

<p>“Ally says she wants to teach music, Miss
Frink. You’re always doing nice things for
people. Why not let her give a recital here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the house and show the Farrandale folks what
she’s made of?”</p>

<p>Miss Frink drew near to his chair, attracted
by the interested expression of his face, a vital
look she had not before seen.</p>

<p>“You would like that, eh?” she returned
indulgently. “You want to give a party? I’ve
never given a party,” she added thoughtfully.
“I’ve never had the courage.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden and I will back you up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Ogden, edging nearer the
tortured letter, but even then unable to get as
close to it as Miss Frink was.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hugh Stanwood Sinclair,” stood out
clearly on the envelope, and Ogden could see
that its owner was miles away from the consciousness
of it.</p>

<p>He slid around Miss Frink’s back. “Excuse
me, Mrs. Re—Lumbard, my letter, please.”</p>

<p>Adèle flattened the bent thing quickly. “Oh,
pardon me,” she said, and put it in the outstretched
hand. Mechanically, and from the
force of fixed habit to see everything, especially
those things which it was desired she should
not see, she glanced at the letter in passing
it; but her attention was quickly absorbed in
Hugh’s further suggestions regarding publicity
for her, and she was divided between hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and fear as to the effect on Miss Frink of his
interest.</p>

<p>Miss Frink continued to stand there, looking
down absorbedly into the boy’s gay face, and
listening quietly. Hugh laughed and joked with
Ogden, planning how they would be ushers on
the great occasion, and she stood still, watching
him.</p>

<p>Adèle started to rise. With a motion of her
hand Miss Frink prevented her. “Sit still,
Adèle.”</p>

<p>Downstairs a little later Leonard Grimshaw
left the study intending to go up to his room.</p>

<p>Stebbins was just opening the front door as
he came through the hall. Millicent Duane
entered. She bowed to the secretary, but addressed
herself to the servant.</p>

<p>“Will you please show me to the White
Room?” she said.</p>

<p>Grimshaw, after a patronizing return of her
greeting, was moving toward the stairway, but
now he paused. “What did you wish, Miss
Millicent?”</p>

<p>“Miss Frink sent me for some records and
asked me to bring them here to the White
Room.”</p>

<p>“Records?” Grimshaw looked dazed. “I
thought I heard a band in the street a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
minutes ago. I wonder if Miss Frink—” He
paused and fixed his round spectacles on Millicent
as if he suspected her of being in some plot.</p>

<p>The girl turned again toward Stebbins.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to go up. I’ll take them,”
the secretary came forward and held out his
hand for the parcel.</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I want to do just what
Miss Frink asked me to.” The girl clasped her
package closer.</p>

<p>Grimshaw smiled disagreeably. “The White
Room is a very attractive place, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it,” returned
the girl, her cheeks reddening at his manner.
“I only know that I feel I would rather do
exactly what Miss Frink asked. She may have
a further errand for me.”</p>

<p>The secretary motioned to Stebbins to go.</p>

<p>“I will take you, then,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>He preceded her up the stairs in silence,
thinking his own disturbed thoughts about that
band in the street, and poor broken Miss
Frink’s obsession.</p>

<p>Arrived at the door of the White Room, they
could hear a buzz of voices within, and a man’s
laugh. The secretary knocked punctiliously,
and Miss Frink herself opened the door.</p>

<p>“That’s a good child,” she said to Millicent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
“You made good time. I think you must have
read ‘A Message to Garcia.’ Come in and meet
Prince Charming.”</p>

<p>Millicent, her cheeks stinging in the sudden
understanding of the secretary’s gibe, yielded
up her package, and with wide eyes beheld the
smiling face above the dressing-gown. She impulsively
took a step backward and Adèle’s lip
curled at her expression.</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Miss Frink, “come right in.
That’s what she called you, Hugh, before she
even knew of your existence. Prince Charming.
Now see if you can live up to it.”</p>

<p>Hugh rose, and, though his mind was still
echoing with their jokes about the recital, this
surprising statement fixed his attention on the
blushing, unsmiling girl with the startled eyes,
whom Miss Frink was drawing forward. “Miss
Duane, Prince Charming,” she said.</p>

<p>The two young things gazed at each other.
Poor little intense, conscious Millicent could
only nod, her eyes frightened and fascinated.</p>

<p>Hugh nodded, too, smiling. “A case of mistaken
identity, Miss Duane,” he said, and
dropped back into his chair.</p>

<p>Millicent noted the proximity to it of
Mrs. Lumbard’s, as she gave a little nod toward
Adèle and breathed her name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden,” said Miss Frink, without
releasing the girl’s hand, “this is my friend
Miss Duane; no, don’t go, Millicent. I want
you to stay and hear these things you’ve
brought. Perhaps we shall want to send them
back.”</p>

<p>Leonard Grimshaw had remained in the
room, and stood sphinx-like, his eyes first on
the new piece of furniture and then on Adèle,
who appeared to be chatting with Hugh in the
manner of an old friend.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lumbard noted his surprise.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I told you I worked in
France, Leonard,” she said. “Imagine my
amazement to find that Mr. Stanwood is one
of my old Buddies.”</p>

<p>The secretary received this information with
a stiff bow.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Grim. Never mind me,” said
Miss Frink. “Mr. Ogden is teaching me how
to run this new plaything. Here”—she carried
the unwrapped records to Hugh—“choose
your opening number.”</p>

<p>Adèle, with her head close to his, pointed out
the desired ragtime. Miss Frink took it back to
the machine.</p>

<p>Hugh looked at Millicent. Her fair hair was
shining palely under her blue hat. Her cheeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
were glowing. Her eyes were fixed on the music-machine.
How could Miss Frink have been so
cruel! She could feel the secretary’s scornful
spectacles, and Mrs. Lumbard’s cold glance.
This fashionable Mr. Ogden. Probably he was
contemptuous, too, of the countrified errand-girl
so ready to admire Prince Charming.</p>

<p>The music started. As it went on, Miss
Frink, staring at her new purchase, began to
frown in a puzzled way as if it had maliciously
betrayed her, and was chuckling. She finally
turned toward Hugh. His face was beaming.
He had risen and was sitting on the arm of his
chair swinging one of his big satin-shod feet,
while he softly beat his knee with one hand.</p>

<p>He looked so handsome and happy she
glanced at Adèle. “Wicked and happy!” was
her quick mental exclamation. On, to Millicent,
her gaze roved. Plenty of color was
there, but no expression. There was no face
more naturally expressive. Miss Frink began
to suspect that she had embarrassed the girl.</p>

<p>The strains ceased, and “silence like a
poultice” fell.</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Hugh, gayly snapping his
fingers. “That’s the stuff.”</p>

<p>“You liked that?” exclaimed Miss Frink.
“You like to be cross-eyed and pigeon-toed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>John Ogden laughed. “He’ll never let you
send that one back, Miss Frink. The youth of
to-day have reverted to savagery.”</p>

<p>“My vote is that it should go back,” declared
Leonard Grimshaw. The sphinx had spoken,
and in a voice that cracked.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re in the minority, Grim,” sighed
Miss Frink.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” he said, making one last
stand for the circumspection and decency of
the house. “Mr. Stanwood and Mrs. Lumbard
find it to their taste evidently, but Mr. Ogden
I’m sure does not. I think it is simply disgusting,
and if Millicent Duane is honest she will
say the same.”</p>

<p>His heat amused Hugh, who caught the
glance which the young girl, appealed to,
turned to him, involuntarily. He leaned forward
and held her there. She could not free herself
quickly from that laughing, questioning gaze.</p>

<p>Starting up from her chair she said: “I—I
don’t believe I heard it—much.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t hear it!” exclaimed Miss Frink,
putting her hands over her own suffering ears.</p>

<p>“I—Grandpa is waiting for me, Miss Frink.
If you don’t need me any more—”</p>

<p>“No, child. I don’t need you. Thank you,
and run along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent swept the room with a vague,
inclusive nod, and, going out into the hall,
hurried to the stairs, and ran down. Her breath
came fast, her eyes were dim and she stumbled.
Some one behind her, unheard on the thick
covering, caught her. She started and flung a
hand across her eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you have your cab wait, Miss Duane?”
asked John Ogden.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">MILLICENT DUANE</span></h2>

<p>She glanced at him through the moisture. His
face was seriously questioning. “No—I sent
it away,” she replied indistinctly.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind I’ll walk on with you a
bit, then.” He took his hat and opened the
door for her. “My favorite part of the day,” he
added.</p>

<p>In silence they crossed the wide veranda, and
when they were descending the steps Millicent
spoke again: “It sounded very foolish, for me
to say I didn’t hear that record.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are one of the fortunate people
who can close their ears to what they don’t wish
to hear.” They passed through the iron gates.
“Or perhaps you didn’t want to take sides. I
saw Mr. Stanwood trying to hypnotize you.”</p>

<p>Millicent met her companion’s kind smile.
“Why did Miss Frink want to make me feel so
foolish?” she burst out impetuously.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she didn’t wish to or mean to.
You shouldn’t grudge her a little fun. I’m
certain she doesn’t have much. What she said
shouldn’t have been embarrassing. It was
extremely mysterious, however.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent regarded her companion again,
suspiciously; but his was a most reassuring face,
and, besides, he had a number of gray hairs.</p>

<p>“She said,” he went on, “that you called Mr.
Stanwood Prince Charming before you knew of
his existence. Nothing in that to offend you,
but a riddle of riddles all the same, to me.”</p>

<p>Ogden’s pleasant voice soothing her vanity
made swallowing a much easier matter. “You
see,” she hesitated, “I used to be in Ross
Graham’s.”</p>

<p>“Long ago?” He glanced at her childlike
profile.</p>

<p>“Yes.—About three days. Miss Frink
bought something of me—and I said—it was
fit for Prince Charming—and Miss Frink
didn’t know about fairy tales.”</p>

<p>“I dare say not,” remarked Ogden.</p>

<p>“So I told her, and we—we got acquainted
that way.”</p>

<p>“Not that gorgeous robe!” said Ogden,
suddenly enlightened.</p>

<p>“Yes, that horrid dressing-gown!”</p>

<p>“Horrid? It’s a dream!”</p>

<p>“Yes, a nightmare.”</p>

<p>“What’s all this? What’s all this?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know he was there—in Miss
Frink’s house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“She said you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was for him.”</p>

<p>“She said so.”</p>

<p>Millicent of the glowing cheeks turned
quickly on her companion; and he smiled into
her disturbed eyes.</p>

<p>“There is only one explanation of Miss
Frink’s remark causing you embarrassment,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course I know I ought to have said
something bright, and funny, and careless, but
I never am bright, and funny, and careless.
What do you mean by explanation?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just that the—the disturbing fact was
that you found you had hit the nail on the head:
that he <em>was</em> Prince Charming, you know.”</p>

<p>If Millicent’s cheeks could have gained a
deeper hue it would have been there. Her
temples grew rosy, and her lips parted. A little
frown met her companion.</p>

<p>“Now, if it had been I that sat there sporting
all those crimson jewels, I, with my high forehead,
and silver threads among the gold, you
would just have given a little sympathetic grin
at Papa, and curtsied, and let it go at that.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden,” with displeasure, “I am not
so—”</p>

<p>“Just let me tell you, Miss Duane, so you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
think better of him, that Prince Charming isn’t
working at it as a profession at all. I never saw
anybody whose good looks disturbed him less.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden, do you suppose—”</p>

<p>“So I don’t want you to let it set you against
him, or feel the way you did when you ran downstairs
just now. By the way, Miss Duane, do
you happen to be related to the Colonel Duane
who has a war record? Very distinguished
man. I’ve heard he lives in Farrandale.”</p>

<p>The speaker had the pleasure of watching the
transformation in the transparent face, from
bewildered resentment to eagerness.</p>

<p>“There!” he said suddenly, “I suspected you
had a dimple. If I had been wearing that dressing-gown,
I should have seen it sooner.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Grandpa. Colonel Duane is my
grandfather.—Perhaps you knew it all the
time, and that is the reason you’ve been so—so
disrespectful in your talk.”</p>

<p>Ogden laughed. “Indeed, the fact should
have made me far more respectful. I didn’t
know it, but your pretty name brought up the
association. I certainly should like to meet
Colonel Duane.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re going to,” said Millicent
eagerly. “We live together and we have a
garden. We live in one of Miss Frink’s houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and when I used to be in Ross Graham’s—”</p>

<p>“Three days ago,” put in Ogden.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems three months. Then I had so
little time with him; but now that I only have
to get Miss Frink to sleep—”</p>

<p>“To sleep!”</p>

<p>“Not at night, you know. Just in the daytime.
She has some one come and read to her,
and now it’s me. It used to be another girl,
but she bobbed her hair and lost the place.
Poor Damaris! I do so wish I could get Miss
Frink to let her have my position in the gloves,
Miss Frink hates bobbed hair so. Do you
think you might help, Mr. Ogden?”</p>

<p>“Anything I can do. Buy her some hair
tonic, perhaps?”</p>

<p>Millicent laughed. “I may ask you to help,”
she said earnestly. “We’re nearly there, Mr.
Ogden, and I want to tell you before we meet
Grandpa that I appreciate your kindness in
seeing that I was unhappy and running after
me. Mrs. Lumbard—do you know Mrs.
Lumbard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, she—even in that short time she
made me feel I was in the way—and—and
everything was wrong. I don’t want you to
think I’m too stupid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Ogden met her appealing look. “I understand
you very well,” he said.</p>

<p class="tb">They approached the little old house built
before Farrandale had grown up.</p>

<p>“I’m so pleased that you appreciate
Grandpa,” the girl went on. “You see Grandpa
was a celebrated lawyer when he laid down his
profession to go into that war. He is Somebody!”</p>

<p>Ogden perceived the white-haired figure in the
garden. The old man had the hose in his hand
and was sprinkling plants, shrubs and lawn.</p>

<p class="tb">When Ogden returned to the White Room, he
found Hugh alone and rather impatient.</p>

<p>“Where did you disappear to?” inquired the
boy.</p>

<p>“I eloped with that record-bearing peach.”</p>

<p>“What did you do that for?”</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t you see she was much disturbed
in her mind?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t have pep enough to stand up
against the cockatoo.”</p>

<p>“She had one object in life just then, and
that was to get out of here.”</p>

<p>“We’re kindred spirits, then, even if she
doesn’t care for jazz. Say, I’m going down to
dinner, Ogden,” added the boy eagerly. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
going to get out of these infernal swaddling
clothes—”</p>

<p>Ogden laughed. “There you are kindred
spirits, too,” he said. “The peach has it in for
that dressing-gown.”</p>

<p>Hugh glanced down over it. “That’s queer.
You’d think a girl would just revel in it.”</p>

<p>“Probably she would if you hadn’t been
wearing it.”</p>

<p>Hugh looked inquiring.</p>

<p>“Miss Frink ‘fussed’ her with all that Prince
Charming stuff.”</p>

<p>The boy shook his head. “What was Miss
Frink up to, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Duane used to be in Ross
Graham’s—three days ago; and she sold your
benefactress the royal robe, and told her it was
fit for Prince Charming, not knowing whom it
was for.”</p>

<p>“And that ‘fussed’ her?” asked Hugh incredulously.
“Aren’t girls the limit? What did she
care who it was for, so she made the sale?”</p>

<p>Ogden looked at his protégé quizzically.
“Oh, she’s been to the movies.”</p>

<p>Hugh stared and scowled deeper. “Now,
don’t you get bats in the belfry, too,” he said.</p>

<p>“Miss Duane has retired from business and
is now reader-in-chief to Miss Frink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“So Ally told me. She tried for the job herself
and was turned down, she says.”</p>

<p>“Really? You didn’t seem to realize that
your friend was playing with that letter of
Carol’s some time before I rescued it.”</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t she?”</p>

<p>Ogden raised his eyebrows and smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, shoot!” ejaculated Hugh gloomily,
suddenly understanding. “Say, I ought to be
writing to Carol.”</p>

<p>Ogden nodded. “I have just been sending
her a full day-letter in your name, and you
promised to write at once, and also asked her to
write you in my care, as your plans are unsettled
just now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say they are!” said Hugh emphatically.
He was thoughtful for a space. “Carol all
alone,” he said presently. “I tell you, Mr.
Ogden, it makes me feel like taking a brace and
amounting to something. I read law the last
year before the war. I’d like to go on with it.
If Carol’s partner in the business is unreliable,
I’d like to be able to attend to him.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been talking to an ex-lawyer to-day,
one who has made his mark. Little Miss
Duane’s grandfather. He is a veteran of the
Cuban War. Colonel Duane. Perhaps he has
his law library still.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“He could steer me, anyway,” replied Hugh,
looking interested—“if I should stay on in the
town,” he added, looking away. After another
pause he went on: “It was good fun to see
Ally again and made everything seem more
familiar.”</p>

<p>“How much do you know about Mrs.
Reece-Lumbard?” asked Ogden.</p>

<p>Hugh laughed reminiscently. “Nothing except
those twinkly fingers of hers. She tried
some highbrow stuff on us at first—uplift,
artistic, that kind; but when she found we
walked out on her she changed. Great Scott,
she could whoop it up, and we sang till the roof
nearly lifted. I may have heard her name in
those days, but if I did I’d forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“Well, she married Tom Reece,” said Ogden.
“He was in the Medical Corps over there, and
when they came home they had a baby with
them, and Mrs. Reece, being a very gay lady,
they had lots of trouble. She was shining in
cabaret performances when I knew her, and
last winter I learned that there was a divorce.
To-day I asked her, when we were alone in the
hall, about her baby girl, and she said she
hadn’t brought her, fearing a child in the house
might annoy her Aunt Susanna.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was considerate, wasn’t it?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
returned Hugh, in defense against Ogden’s
manner. “A woman never gets any sympathy.”</p>

<p>“The courts didn’t give Mrs. Reece any,”
said Ogden dryly. “I knew that Dr. Reece
was given the custody of the little girl. I just
wanted to see what she would say about it.”</p>

<p>Hugh’s brow clouded. “I’m sorry to hear
of that mess,” he replied. “Is that why you
think she is deceiving Miss Frink about herself?
People that live in glass houses, you
know.”</p>

<p>Ogden smiled. “Yes, I’m not going into
the stone business at present.”</p>

<p>The dinner that night was what Adèle called
a really human meal. Miss Frink sat at the
head of the table and her secretary at the foot.
He did the honors in a highly superior manner.
Adèle sat at his right and the two men guests
were placed, one each side the hostess.</p>

<p>Miss Frink looked thoughtfully at Hugh,
dressed in the new suit she had paid for. He
was happy in his promotion from the invalid
chair, and responded to Mr. Ogden’s amusing
stories, while Adèle put aside dull care and told
canteen reminiscences of her own, some of
them sufficiently daring to draw upon her the
gaze of the neighboring spectacles.</p>

<p>After dinner they all adjourned to the drawing-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and Miss Frink, for the first time
in all the years, saw its dignified furnishings
as background to a social gathering. Adèle
played, and Hugh sauntered up and down
the room, singing when the familiar melodies
tempted him. Miss Frink’s eyes followed him
with a strange, unconscious hunger.</p>

<p>When at last Mrs. Lumbard sought her
pillow, she was too excited for sleep, and the
little spurt of jollity faded into the dull consideration
of her situation. Why had handsome
Hughie made that break about her hair! She
reviewed all that had been said in his first
recognition of her. She saw herself again,
sitting and nervously twisting that letter.
She felt something inimical in Ogden. He had
known Dr. Reece. He wanted to get his letter
away from her. There, in the darkness of her
unquiet pillow, she saw the twisted envelope
again. It was not his letter at all. She had
flattened it out and seen that it was Hughie’s.</p>

<p>Mr. Hugh Stanwood Sinclair. She saw the
address again. Sinclair. Why? when Hughie’s
name was Stanwood? Why was the address
Sinclair? Her head lay quieter as she meditated.
Mr. Ogden had been anxious to get that letter!
He had made her feel rebuked for twisting it.
She lay a long time awake.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">ALICE</span></h2>

<p>When Miss Frink went to her room that night,
two red spots burned in her cheeks. She was a
creature of habit and proud of it. Her maid
had the bed turned down and prepared for
the night as usual. A silk negligée hung over
the back of a chair. The silver carafe of ice
water with its cut-glass tumbler stood by the
side of the bed. Her programme would be to
slip off the black satin gown, don the negligée,
go to the lighted bathroom and wind the waves
of her front hair back on their crimping pins,
and so proceed to the point of extinguishing
the lights, getting into bed, and going at once
to sleep.</p>

<p>The mental picture behind those red spots
was of the same envelope which was absorbing
Adèle’s meditations. It had lain directly in the
line of Miss Frink’s bi-focals when Mrs. Lumbard
gave it its final flattening. Miss Frink
crossed the room to where the enlarged portrait
of her girlhood’s chum hung on the wall.</p>

<p>“Come on, Alice, let’s talk it over as we used
to,” she said, and with a quick movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
unhooking the picture, she sat down in the
nearest chair with it in her lap, and gazed into
the eyes. “I want to look at a friend. I’m
seventy-odd, Alice, and you’re still my only
one: the only being who has ever loved me.”
She paused in her soliloquy to swallow something.
“I’m not going to make a tragedy of it.
I could have adopted a child after Philip disappointed
me. I could have had some one
to love me, but I liked business better than
domesticity, so I made my own bed and I’m
not going to complain of it. You told me I
was all wrong about Philip, wrong in not
giving him his freedom, wrong to quarrel with
him, wrong to cut myself off from him, I
remember now everything you said, though I
haven’t thought of it for years. The book was
closed. Nothing could have surprised me more
than to have it opened again. But, Alice”—Miss
Frink’s hand pressed the sides of the
picture frame until it hurt—“it is only my
money. That is the humiliation. I couldn’t
believe that I would feel it so.” The soliloquizing
lips quivered. “Your Adèle—if she is
yours, something in me cries out all the time
that she is not—what interest would she have
had in an Aunt Susanna who was old and poor?
She fawns on me with meek, loving expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
as if I could be fooled. Forgive me, dear, but
you wouldn’t like her, either. There’s Grim,
of course; it’s a religion with him to look after
me, but he hasn’t any natural, spontaneous
interest in his fellow-beings. The calf of gold
rules his consciousness. He’s narrow, narrow
as I am myself. Oh, Alice, if I had you here!
If I could only do it over again and do it better.”
For the first time in years tears stood in
Miss Frink’s eyes. She winked them away
quietly, and fell into meditation. Presently,
her thoughts seething through the past and
present, her lips moved again:</p>

<p>“John Ogden is a finished rascal; polished,
suave, a real society man. Full of charm he is,
and I wonder how he ran into the boy, and
persuaded him. I’m hurt, Alice. Hugh’s old
Aunt Sukey is hurt;—but it’s better to be
hurt than dead, and he didn’t know who he
was saving, I have that comfort. That was
no part of John Ogden’s plan; and it makes
the boy more mine than Ogden’s. He hasn’t
been happy a minute since he came, and the
why is plain. He hates the double-dealing,
while Ogden thinks it is the best joke going.
I hate lies, Alice”—with sudden heat. “You
know I always did; and the humiliation—why
does it cut me so that the boy, my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
flesh and blood that I’m mightily near to loving,
has cold-bloodedly entered into some plan
that has only my money for its object? I’ve
been a dupe; and, of course, any young person
would chuckle over my sympathy for his
delirious longing for Aunt Sukey. Alice!”—suddenly
Miss Frink clutched the picture frame
again—“that girl—that photograph—is his
mother. He said Aunt Sukey opposed her tooth
and nail, and I asked him if I could do anything.
He said it was too late.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink let the picture slide down into
her lap while she followed this train of thought
and looked into space. Presently she propped
the frame up again between her hands.</p>

<p>“Of course, Alice, that single night in
which your much-married granddaughter’s hair
turned white might have come before she went
over to France. I’m about as mean to the girl
in my thoughts as anybody could be, and she
has made the boy look really happy for the
first time in all these weeks. I ought to give her
some credit for that. It was pleasant down in
the drawing-room to-night through her means;
but the iron had entered into my soul, and I
felt inside the way Grim looked outside. Poor
Grim, he is not a society man. He doesn’t
want our habits changed. Now, I’m up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
against another fight, Alice, girl. It’s a long
time since I’ve had to fight. It’s a temptation
to say to them all—Ogden, the boy, and
Adèle—‘I know you through and through.
I’m not the dupe you think me. Get away
all of you and never let me see you again.’
But, Alice, what’s the use of living seventy
years unless you’ve learned to do nothing impulsively?
I look right back to my treatment
of Philip Sinclair and recall the things you said
to me then. I shall let you help me, Alice.
I will take the advice that I scorned thirty
years ago. Good-night, Alice, girl.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink didn’t sleep much that night,
and the next morning, the weather having made
a sudden start summerward, she felt a new
chapter of her life beginning.</p>

<p>Hugh came down to breakfast with John
Ogden, and Adèle was ready with new ideas
for her recital. Miss Frink allowed herself to
be carried along on the tide of their talk until
breakfast was over.</p>

<p>“What a lovely morning. Your grounds are
charming,” said Ogden.</p>

<p>“Everything is blooming,” returned the hostess.
“Let us make a little tour of inspection.”</p>

<p>She led the way through the small conservatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
attached to the dining-room, and out upon
the lawn.</p>

<p>“How beautifully this place is kept,” said
Ogden.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have so few amusements,” assented
his companion.</p>

<p>“Thoroughness is your watchword, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>“I believe it is,” she agreed. “Whether I
was doing right or wrong, I always seem to have
made a clean sweep of it.”</p>

<p>Ogden regarded her in genuine admiration.
“All your thoughts must be of satisfaction,
I should think.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink tossed her head with a dissenting
gesture. “You’d think wrong then, man. Let
us sit down here awhile.”</p>

<p>She led the way to a rustic seat under an elm
tree. “Shan’t I go in and get a wrap for you?”
asked Ogden. The prospect of a tête-à-tête
with his hostess was not without its qualms.</p>

<p>“No, no. This sun is hot.”</p>

<p>“So is this one,” thought Ogden, but he
smiled with his usual air of finding the present
situation inspiring.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how you came to take such
an interest in Hugh,” began his companion
without prelude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Through liking his father, and loving his
sister,” replied Ogden glibly.</p>

<p>“Eh? His sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes, his sister Carol. She couldn’t see me,”
continued Ogden cheerfully. “She married a
man named Morrison and went to Colorado.
Hugh received word yesterday that her husband
has died. She is left with two little children”
(Miss Frink began to stiffen mechanically,
and Ogden saw it), “but she is a young woman
after your own heart. Her husband’s illness
was a long one, and she learned his business in
order to carry it on, and she won’t allow Hugh
to come out there or worry himself about her.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink gazed at him with unconscious
fixedness. “Yes. His mother’s name was
Carol,” was the thought behind her stiff lips.</p>

<p>“Hugh couldn’t seem to find himself when
he came back from France, and was rather
down in the mouth when I got hold of him, so
I thought. He is so young, it would be better
for him to learn a business from the bottom up,
and I thought of Ross Graham’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you thought of Ross Graham’s.”
Miss Frink nodded slowly and continued
to meet her companion’s debonair look. “I
wonder why you thought of Ross Graham’s.”</p>

<p>“I told you in my letter of introduction,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
responded Ogden, without hesitation. “It is
just one of the compact pieces of perfection that
you have been bringing about all your life.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink nodded acceptance of the compliment
and of his self-possession.</p>

<p>“I should say his nerve was one piece of
perfection,” she reflected; and then her habit
of honest thought questioned how she would
have received the frank proposition. If John
Ogden had come to her with the information
that she had a robust, handsome, grand-nephew,
Philip Sinclair’s son, who needed a
boost toward finding his right place in the
world, would she have listened to him? Would
she have received the boy? She would not,
and she knew it.</p>

<p>Ogden was speaking on: “How little I
dreamed that I was doing as much for you as
for Hugh when I saw him off on that train.”</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps some other bystander would
have saved the old lady,” she replied, with
sudden rebellion against Ogden’s making a
virtue of his duplicity.</p>

<p>“Really?” he returned suavely. “I have
understood that Hugh had the street all to
himself just at that time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think he did,” said Miss Frink
brusquely, looking away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Ogden’s gray eyes were rather large and
prominent, and just now their gaze irritated her.</p>

<p>“You know it is very interesting to me,” he
went on, “that the mere fact of my choosing
Ross Graham’s for Hugh rather than some
other concern, should have saved your valuable
life. I believe in Providence, Miss Frink.
Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I believe that Heaven helps those who help
themselves,” she retorted; “and that’s you,
I’m sure, Mr. Ogden.”</p>

<p>“But we’re not talking about me,” he responded
with a gay air of surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to,” responded Miss
Frink. “I want you to tell me everything you
know about Mrs. Lumbard.”</p>

<p>“Why—” he returned, clearing his throat
to gain time, “it’s on the surface. She is a very
pretty woman who is a fine musician. You can
tell by Hugh’s attitude what she meant to the
boys over there, and she has a reputation all
through the South.”</p>

<p>“Did you know her before her marriage when
she was Miss Morehouse?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What was her father like?”</p>

<p>“Why—” Ogden hesitated. “I understood
they were your relatives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. They’re not. Is her father living?”</p>

<p>“I—I really don’t know; but Mr. Morehouse
died only last year.”</p>

<p>“Well, he was her father, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“No; he married her mother when the
daughter was a child prodigy at the piano.”</p>

<p>Such a strange change passed over Miss
Frink that Ogden was startled. She gazed at
him out of a face as stiff as parchment.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden, I am uncanny. My feelings are
uncanny,” she said at last. “You might as well
be sitting under an X-ray as by me. I know the
whole truth about you. I know all your double-dealings—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Frink, why should you give me
heart failure? I don’t know why you should be
so excited. I hope I haven’t told any tales.”
Ogden flushed to the ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, a great big one, but, oh, the relief it is
to me. She has nothing to do with my Alice.
Be careful not to let her know that you’ve told
me this. Once I had a friend, Mr. Ogden, a real
friend. She never tried to get the better of
me. She never deceived me. She loved me as
herself.”</p>

<p>John Ogden thought he had never looked into
such bright eyes, and their strenuous gaze
seeming, as she had claimed, to see absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
through him, sent a prickling sensation down
his spine. She seemed to be contrasting him
with that single-minded friend, frightfully to his
disadvantage.</p>

<p>“She has died,” went on the low voice, “and
I never found another. Now Mrs. Lumbard
has claimed me through her; claimed to be her
granddaughter. I never could believe it, and it
seems I was right.”</p>

<p>Ogden frowned and shook his head. “If
you’re glad, I suppose I shouldn’t regret my
break; but I wouldn’t for anything have thrown
a monkey-wrench into Mrs. Re—Lumbard’s
machinery if I had known.”—“Supposing
Miss Frink knew all!” was his reflection.</p>

<p>His companion nodded slowly. “Let me
have the truth once in a while, once in a while.
Don’t grudge it to me. You’ve only clinched
my feeling that she is a liar.”</p>

<p>Ogden looked up toward the porch where
Adèle and Hugh were laughing.</p>

<p>“There is one thing I wanted to speak of
to you. You take such a kindly interest in
Hugh—”</p>

<p>“That is barely decent,” responded Miss
Frink with sudden sharpness. “What is it you
want? When a poor young man saves the life
of a rich old woman, it is to be expected that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
she gives him a good plump check as reward,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Ogden regarded her in surprise. “What the
love of money does to people!” was his reflection.
“I shan’t tell Hugh you said that,” he
replied quietly. “He has had enough to bear.
You know whether his attitude toward you is
mercenary.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s old cheeks flushed in their turn.
“Well, I know it isn’t,” she said bluntly; “but
you are his manager, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“My dear lady! Please don’t spoil this
beautiful morning.”</p>

<p>“I’m excited, Ogden. I know it,” she said
nervously. She was glad he had trapped her,
but how had he dared to do it, and how could
she forgive him!</p>

<p>“This is what I was going to say,” he went
on. “The last year before Hugh went to France
he read law. Since hearing that his sister is
alone, he feels that he would like to go on with
it. He might be able to help her some day.
Yesterday I met Colonel Duane. He is a
lawyer and still has a good library. What
would you think of Hugh’s working at that,
evenings?”</p>

<p>“Why evenings?”</p>

<p>“Because I judge you intend to give him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
job in the store that will at least partly pay his
board.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink looked off at the fountain where
two marble babies were having an unending
water duel, and apparently from their expressions
having great fun over it.</p>

<p>“That is a very good idea,” she said, “to
read law with Colonel Duane.”</p>

<p>Ogden accepted her ignoring of the “job.”
There was a change in her since yesterday. She
seemed to be smothering and controlling some
spite against himself. If she suspected anything,
he must prepare Hugh. The sudden
meeting with Ally and the plan to help her with
the recital had changed the boy’s gloomy, rebellious
mood; and certainly nothing had occurred
since last evening, when Miss Frink had
been a sufficiently complacent though passive
hostess.</p>

<p>“I will attend to the matter,” she said after a
pause, and rose. “I must go in. Grim will
wonder if I am forgetting the mail.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">APPLE BLOSSOMS</span></h2>

<p>Adèle was in a porch swing, her pretty slippers
and ankles very much in evidence when Miss
Frink and Ogden came up on the veranda. She
was singing “Madelon,” and Hugh was trying
to stop her, amid much laughter and threatening.</p>

<p>The lady of the old school crossed to her and
pulled down the skirt of the young woman’s
pink dimity morning dress. It would have kept
Miss Frink busy if she had performed that
office for all the girls in Farrandale who needed
it that morning, and all the mornings; although
Farrandale was no more lax than any other
town.</p>

<p>Adèle rose quickly from the swinging seat,
and Miss Frink turned to Hugh. “Well, what’s
this I hear about our young lawyer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, has Mr. Ogden told you of my wish
to read with Colonel Duane? I’m keen for it,
Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>That lady looked up into his eager face with
a lingering regard. What would he say if she
told him here and now that she knew him to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hers; her own flesh and blood; she who but a
few weeks ago had believed herself alone in the
world? This splendid specimen of young manhood
was hers, hers to assist or to renounce.
Her habitual shrewdness and forethought
warned her that she did not know him: that he
must show the stuff he was made of before she
could discover whether she cared to own him.
He was deceiving her, at the present moment.
He was only watching for opportunities to use
her. No wonder his conscience had revolted at
the succession of favors pressed upon him by
the woman he was hoodwinking. Miss Frink’s
X-ray mentality told her that here was an
honest thought manipulated by the man of the
world with whom she had just been tête-à-tête.
Nevertheless, Hugh was at fault. He should
have spurned such a plan—“And let you lie
under the simple granite monument provided
for in your will?” added some small inner voice.</p>

<p>Probably that suggestion was what made her
smile at him now, so reflectively.</p>

<p>“That is, if Colonel Duane is willing to be
bothered with me,” went on the boy, still
eagerly. “I can’t trust you, Miss Frink. I
won’t have the old gentleman bound hand and
foot and thrown down at my feet.”</p>

<p>This egregious remark touched Miss Frink’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
sense of humor. She laughed spontaneously.
The implication of her power pleased her no
less than that of her devotion to this dastardly,
double-faced youth.</p>

<p>“You just mind your own business, Hugh,”
she returned. “You shall see the Colonel to-day.”</p>

<p>“I should love to walk over there with him,”
said Adèle.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” replied Miss Frink, “but do
you know Colonel Duane?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, but—”</p>

<p>“I think another arrangement would be
better,” said Miss Frink, and, turning, went
into the house.</p>

<p>Adèle pretended to shiver. “Oh, she does sit
on me so hard!” she cried, then she dropped
back into the porch seat and continued her gay
badinage with Hugh, the undercurrent of her
thought triumphing over her difficult hostess,
inasmuch as she knew her to be a dupe and
could reveal it, at any time.</p>

<p>John Ogden watched the young woman uneasily.
It was evident that she was doing her
best to attract Hugh.</p>

<p>“Say, boy, I’d look out for Ally if I were
you,” said Ogden when again they were alone.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s lots of fun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, she means to be; but she’s in wrong
with Miss Frink. It seems she is here, entirely
under false pretenses.”</p>

<p>Hugh turned and stared down at his mentor.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” he replied. “How shocking!”</p>

<p>“Miss Frink has found it out,” said Ogden,
flushing, “and through me. That’s the worst
of it.”</p>

<p>“A little stone-throwing in your glass house,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Totally unintentional.” And Ogden repeated
what had taken place.</p>

<p>Hugh stared into space. He hated to have
people get in wrong. It disturbed him all the
time that Ally should have been such a fool as
to deserve to get in wrong with the courts.</p>

<p>“Of course Miss Frink doesn’t dream of the
court disgrace,” added Ogden.</p>

<p>“Women always get the worst of it,” said
Hugh moodily.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve no doubt she will at least keep
her word about the recital,” remarked Ogden.</p>

<p>“We must take it for granted,” said Hugh
energetically. “We must help the poor girl,
and have some pep about it.”</p>

<p>Ogden laughed. “You can be trusted for
pep,” he returned. “That was a good line
about Colonel Duane. I should have expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Miss Frink to have Grimshaw escort your conceited
self to the gate.”</p>

<p>At that moment the Colonel was watching a
pair of birds feeding their young. Millicent
came to the door and called him in to the
’phone.</p>

<p>“It is Miss Frink,” she said with bated
breath. “I do hope it is nothing about me.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman patted her hand as he took
the receiver, and the girl stood with parted lips,
listening.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, if an old fogy like myself can be
of any use to him, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, plenty of time. I’m a very small
farmer, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have the foundational books.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you would, Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>“To-day? Yes, I shall be very glad to see
him.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I shall be here.”</p>

<p>Colonel Duane hung up the receiver and
smiled at the girl with the rapt eyes.</p>

<p>“No, you’re not discharged, my dear. She
has another errand for you to do.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Grandpa?”</p>

<p>“Don’t lose those eyes out, my dear. You’re
sure to need them again some time. The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
man there, Mr. Stanwood, wants to come over
here to see my law books.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it isn’t Mr. Ogden?” asked
Millicent earnestly. “He was so interested in
everything yesterday.”</p>

<p>“No, it is Mr. Stanwood. It seems he started
to read law, and then they needed him in
France.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I told Mr. Ogden that you were a celebrated
lawyer.”</p>

<p>“You little girl! Blowing the old man’s
horn.” He put his arm around her.</p>

<p>“What is the errand, Grandpa?”</p>

<p>“To bring Mr. Stanwood over here.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“When you get through the reading, he will
be waiting for you on the veranda.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why Mr. Ogden doesn’t bring
him.”</p>

<p>“Why should he, when you are coming right
home, anyway? Possibly Mr. Ogden doesn’t
care to call on us every day.”</p>

<p>What could be simpler than picking Mr.
Stanwood up on the veranda, and showing him
the way to her grandfather? Millicent was
vexed with herself for feeling as if she were setting
out on an adventure when she went to her
reading that day. She could see Hugh as he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
on the arm of his easy-chair, bejeweled with
crimson petals, swinging his gay foot, and snapping
his fingers in time to the jazz. At least he
would not have on that cursed dressing-gown
to-day, and she would show him by her businesslike
manner that she was simply doing an errand
for Miss Frink in being his escort.</p>

<p>When that lady lost consciousness to-day,
and began gently to blow the silk handkerchief
thrown over her face, Millicent despised
the sensation of her heart beginning to beat a
little faster as she tripped down the wide staircase
to the ponderous front door. As she came
out upon the veranda, she saw him. He was
sitting in the porch swing with Mrs. Lumbard,
and Mrs. Lumbard looked unusually pretty in
a pink dimity gown, and was exhibiting lengths
of crossed silk stockings as she impelled the
swing with the tip of one slipper.</p>

<p>Hugh at once jumped up, and Adèle nodded.
“You made a short job of it to-day,” she remarked,
and Millicent hated her.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are not quite ready, Mr.
Stanwood,” she said, with what was Farrandale’s
most formal and forbidding manner.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I am,” he replied, picking up his hat.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’d better take an overcoat,
Hughie?” asked Adèle affectionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, indeed, it’s warm. Well, good-bye,
Ally, I won’t ask you to be good—just to be
as good as you can.”</p>

<p>She laughed and threw him a kiss. Millicent
stood, stiff as a ramrod, hating them both.</p>

<p>Hugh smiled at her disarmingly as they went
down the steps together. “You know I am as
pleased as a boy with a pair of red boots to
think Colonel Duane will take me,” he said.</p>

<p>“He seemed very willing,” returned the
girl, without looking at him.</p>

<p>Had Damaris been the escort of the most
talked-about young man in Farrandale, she
would have paraded him: taken him by the
most populous ways. Millicent had mapped out
a semi-rural route, longer to be sure, but one in
which few people would see them and say that
Millicent Duane was out walking with Miss
Frink’s young man.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lumbard worked among us doughboys
in France,” said Hugh, sensing an iciness
in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“I heard her say so yesterday,” returned
Millicent, eyes ahead.</p>

<p>“She plays like a house afire,” said Hugh,
“and she has to earn her living. Do you believe
she could make a go of it teaching piano
here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know why not?” returned the girl
civilly.</p>

<p>“Anyway, Miss Frink is going to let her give
a recital in her house and let the people hear
her. Will you help boom it?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m a person of no influence, Mr.
Stanwood.”</p>

<p>Hugh regarded the persistent profile, a very
grave profile with a slightly tilted nose.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden says you had a grouch yesterday,”
he said good-humoredly. “Is this a
hang-over?”</p>

<p>At this she turned and gave him a look
which came out somewhere beyond him. “I
don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t seem to realize that this is a
great day. Spring is here, and the birds are
busy—this is a mighty pretty street, by the
way, like the country, and I’m out of that infernal
room walking on my own legs. I feel we
should be taking hold of hands and skipping—Merry,
Merry May, fol-de-rol, tiddle-de-winks,
and all that, you know.”</p>

<p>She met his laughing eyes and relaxed
slightly. “It is a celebration for you, isn’t it?”
she said.</p>

<p>“Yes. Ogden said Miss Frink teased you
yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, how silly to speak of it!” exclaimed
Millicent, reverting to the profile and coloring
beautifully. He thought she looked very pretty,
and he laughed gayly at her sudden temper.</p>

<p>“Well, I just want you to remember that I
wasn’t the guilty party. An innocent bystander
shouldn’t be crushed, yet how often they are!”</p>

<p>In the rural road, Hugh was effervescing with
the joy of living, and his prim escort was gradually
unbending. When an apple tree in full
bloom came in view, it helped wonderfully.</p>

<p>“Grandpa has a little orchard. It looks
marvelous. You will see—we’re almost there.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Miss Duane”—Hugh
put out a hand gropingly—“just a minute.
I feel queer—”</p>

<p>Millicent looked around at him. He was
very pale.</p>

<p>“Can you beat it?” he demanded feebly.
“That apple tree—it’s whirling. I think I’m—going
to—”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, Mr. Stanwood.” His groping
hand grasped her arm, and she held him with
the other while he sank on the bank under the
apple blossoms, his weight pulling her down
beside him.</p>

<p>“Oh, shoot!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Please don’t faint,” she said. “We’re so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
nearly there. Just lie still; I’ll go get Grandpa
to help.”</p>

<p>She fled away, and he closed his eyes and
called himself names.</p>

<p>Back they came, Millicent white and flushed
by turns, and the old gentleman coming along
with his hale and hearty tread.</p>

<p>“Not such a bad couch,” he said cheerily,
bending over Hugh while Millicent stood with
clasped hands, suffering all the throes of guilt.
The regular road would have been little more
than half as long, and she could hear Mrs.
Lumbard’s comments on choosing the romantic
path.</p>

<p>“Lie there a bit while Milly brings you some
hot milk, then you’ll get to the house easily
enough between us two sturdy ones. Tried to
do a little too much, I guess.”</p>

<p>Millicent went back with winged feet and
soon returned with the hot milk. He drank
the milk, supported by Colonel Duane’s arm,
and soon his dizziness ceased. Leaning on the
two friends he walked slowly, and soon entered
the back gate of their cottage. The little orchard
made the place look in festive array.</p>

<p>“All dressed up for you, you see,” said the
Colonel.</p>

<p>“Heavenly!” said Hugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent was valiantly supporting one of
his arms, and his other was around the Colonel’s
neck.</p>

<p>“I’ll say it’s pretty here,” said Hugh.
“Sorry I was a fool.”</p>

<p>“Going to put you in the hammock,” said
Colonel Duane, “and let you look the apple
blossoms out of countenance awhile.”</p>

<p>This he did, arranging the pillows deftly
under Hugh’s head. He went into the house
for another, and Millicent stood there looking
down at the patient.</p>

<p>Hugh smiled up at her; and there was that
dreadful smile again, that Prince Charming
smile that made so much defense necessary,
and she hadn’t any more. Remorse had
drowned it.</p>

<p>“He’s all right now, childie,” said her
grandfather comfortingly. “I’ll bet you’re
blaming yourself for taking that road. How
did you happen to?”</p>

<p>“It’s lots—lots prettier,” said Millicent
with a gulp. She sank into a receptive rocking-chair.</p>

<p>“And the joke is,” said the Colonel, “that
Miss Frink didn’t think he was up to the short
road, even. She was expecting you to drive,
and somehow or other Grimshaw was tardy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
with the team and you had gone. So he hopped
in and came the whole way, beating up the
sidewalks for you.” Colonel Duane laughed.
“I told him to go over to Damaris and see if
you were there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandpa!” groaned the girl.</p>

<p>“So he went, and he said if he didn’t find
you he would go back and tell Miss Frink that
you preferred to walk.” The old gentleman
laughed again. “Grimshaw believes in self-preservation.
That is what we are all to say.
You preferred to walk.” He rose. “I promised
to call up as soon as you arrived. I’ll tell them
you enjoyed the trip. Eh?”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">MISS FRINK MAKES A CALL</span></h2>

<p>At the tears on Millicent’s face now, Hugh
laughed aloud. She was looking aghast.</p>

<p>“To-morrow everybody will know it!” she
ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Know what?”</p>

<p>“That Mr. Grimshaw couldn’t find us.”
And crystal drops began again to race down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>“You cry-baby!” said Hugh, regarding her
curiously. “Here, I have more of a handkerchief
than that. Come here and I’ll bail while
you pour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, am I crying?” she returned, distractedly
mopping her cheeks. “I must speak to Damaris
as soon as Grandpa gets through. You don’t
know what it is to live in a little town.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that it?” returned Hugh, regarding
her flushed, troubled face, and thinking it was
as sweet as a dew-washed flower. “They’ll
say we eloped, eh? I’ll tell the world I thank
’em for the compliment.”</p>

<p>Colonel Duane here reappeared and Millicent
dashed by him into the house. He seemed
to be serenely unaware of his grandchild’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
excitement, and, telling Hugh not to talk, but
to rest, he seated himself a little way off, and
Hugh had the full benefit of the one-sided
conversation within.</p>

<p>It was a particularly cheerful and care-free
voice speaking, with little gulps in the throat
that caught it at unexpected moments.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Damaris, it’s Millicent. I was
sorry Mr. Grimshaw had to trouble you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m home. It was such a beautiful
day, you know, we walked over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Stanwood had business with
Grandpa, and—and he didn’t understand
that Mr. Grimshaw—What? Yes, didn’t
know that he was expected to wait for the
carriage. What? Yes, it was queer Mr. Grimshaw
didn’t see us. We were just—walking
along, you know, just walking along. What?
Yes, he’s here. He and Grandpa are together.
Did you say Mr. Grimshaw looked scared?
Why, what for? Yes, of course, Mr. Stanwood
isn’t entirely strong yet. Oh, that’s all right.
I just wanted you to know that nobody is lost,
strayed, or stolen.” Suddenly, with great
dignity, the voice changed. “No, no, indeed.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>When Millicent went back to the piazza
after washing her face and applying powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
where it would be most effective, she found her
grandfather seated by his recumbent guest and
asking him about his previous studies.</p>

<p>“You might bring Mr. Stanwood a cup of
bouillon, Milly,” said the Colonel, and the girl
went back into the house.</p>

<p>When she reappeared, her own fresh, fair,
and demure self, bearing her offering, Hugh
looked at her approvingly.</p>

<p>“My life is just one tray after another,” he
said.</p>

<p>The patient had just taken his last swallow
when a sound of wheels was heard. Miss Frink’s
victoria stopped before the gate, and that lady
herself dismounted and came up the path.
Colonel Duane hastened to meet her. Millicent
stood up, holding the tray undecidedly, with
an expression of face which seemed to be
bracing for a <i lang="fr">coup de grace</i>, and Hugh flung a
long leg out of the hammock.</p>

<p>“Lie still, Hugh,” ordered the visitor, waving
her parasol authoritatively.</p>

<p>Hugh withdrew the leg. Miss Frink had
never walked up on that piazza before, although
it was her own property. She looked
around approvingly.</p>

<p>“You’ve made this place lovely, Colonel
Duane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we think it is a good deal of a paradise
this time of year.”</p>

<p>“So you overdid yourself,” said Miss Frink,
seating herself in the offered chair by the
hammock.</p>

<p>Colonel Duane lifted Millicent’s tray and
carried it into the house, and the girl took a
chair near the visitor.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” inquired Hugh
blandly.</p>

<p>“You didn’t come by the road. There was
only one other way you could come.”</p>

<p>No one in the world ever looked guiltier than
Millicent at this moment. Her awe of Miss
Frink kept her eyes dry and very large, but
she saw her job disappearing, and herself
stingingly rebuked.</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s gaze turned upon her.</p>

<p>“What was your idea?” she asked bluntly,
but she was conscious of the picture made by
the blue-gowned girl against the background
of apple blossoms.</p>

<p>Millicent’s lips opened and closed several
times without a sound emerging.</p>

<p>Miss Frink laughed, and exchanged a look
with Hugh.</p>

<p>“You took him down Lover’s Lane. That’s
what you did,” said Miss Frink, regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
girl accusingly. “Of course, it’s ever so much
more romantic than the highroad; but we’ve
got to build Prince Charming up before you
can cut up any such didos as that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Frink!” It was a gasp, not only
of extreme embarrassment, but also of relief
that the matter might be treated jocosely.</p>

<p>“You’re barking up the wrong tree,” said
Hugh, grinning. “I’ve found out what she
did it for. She was hiding me.” Miss Frink
grimaced her glasses off. “Yes, madam, she
lives in a small town and she was hiding me.”</p>

<p>“And set every dog and goose to barking
and cackling,” declared Miss Frink.</p>

<p>“But I revenged myself on her. I waited
till we came to a mossy couch under an apple
tree, and then I keeled over.—Look out”—a
warning hand toward Millicent—“don’t
you cry now. She was the best little sport
you ever heard of. I nearly crushed her poor
little wing while she and Colonel Duane were
getting me up here, and they have filled me
with the milk of human kindness and beef tea
ever since.”</p>

<p>“It was all Grimshaw’s stupidity,” said Miss
Frink. “I put it in his hands and he didn’t
order the carriage in time.” Her lips twitched
amusedly. “He tried to shift the responsibility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and make out that you preferred to walk; but
I X-rayed him. He hadn’t a chance. Did I
ever tell you, Hugh, to beware of my X-ray
mind?” She regarded him quizzically, admiring
his beauty as she always did. “Double-dealing
hasn’t a chance with me. I always see directly
through it.”</p>

<p>Hugh rearranged his pillows. “Quite a business
asset, I should judge,” he returned, and
for a minute his complexion matched the
hectic hue of Millicent. Why should Miss
Frink be boring into him, as it were, with her
dark, bright eyes?</p>

<p>“So when Grim got through the account of
his pilgrimage, I knew you must have come
by Lover’s Lane.” The speaker suddenly
turned again upon the young girl with a
smiling frown.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Frink, I can’t tell you how sorry
I am!” Millicent’s hands were clasped.</p>

<p>“Now, be careful,” broke in Hugh. “Remember
the size of your handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to cry,” she responded, her
voice teetering, as it were, like a person trying
to keep his balance on a tight rope. “I’m so
thankful if you’re not vexed with me. I do
think now it was awfully stupid; but you know
what Farrandale is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bless me!” said Miss Frink. “Then the
child really was trying to hide you!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Millicent frankly; “and then
Mr. Grimshaw went right over to the Coopers’,
hunting!”</p>

<p>Miss Frink gave her rare laugh. Millicent
was so pretty against the apple blossoms, and
so genuinely disturbed, and Hugh so handsome
and amused, she thoroughly enjoyed the
situation.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say you set all the geese to cackling?
I will call a town meeting and announce
that there is nothing in it. How will that
do?”</p>

<p>Millicent struggled not to feel embarrassed.
“With your X-ray mind you’ll know there
isn’t,” she returned, with more spirit than
Hugh had given her credit for.</p>

<p>Colonel Duane reappeared with another
tray. It bore tea and little cakes this time.
Miss Frink liked the way his granddaughter
sprang to his assistance and arranged everything
on the porch table. Colonel Duane was
a gentleman of the old school and his breeding
showed in Millicent. She liked their simplicity
and fineness. The girl’s job was never safer.</p>

<p>When tea was served, Millicent opened a
subject near her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Frink,” she said, “will you let me beg
a favor of you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Speak right up.”</p>

<p>“It is about Damaris. I have experimented,
and I can fix her hair so you would never know
it was bobbed.”</p>

<p>The caller eyed her sharply. “Are you tired
of reading to me?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” The ejaculation was earnest.
“But couldn’t she have my place in the gloves,
if—if I show you the way I can fix her hair?
And she is so attractive, and bright, and pretty,
and people would love to have her fit them,
and she knows so many people—” The girl
stopped, it was so extraordinary to be talking
courageously to Miss Frink.</p>

<p>That lady turned toward Colonel Duane.
“Your granddaughter would make a good
press-agent, wouldn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Milly would,” he returned, composedly
sipping his tea.</p>

<p>“Then if people didn’t believe her she would
cry,” remarked Hugh.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about your crying, Millicent?”
asked Miss Frink.</p>

<p>“When I’ve done wrong, like making Mr.
Stanwood too tired and—and having everybody
talk about it, I cry; that’s natural, isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
it? But never mind his teasing. I wish I could
get the place for Damaris.”</p>

<p>“This generation is so full of silly girls,”
said Miss Frink. “Hugh, have you your
mother’s picture in your pocket?”</p>

<p>He blinked, and colored again. Throwing
his long legs out of the hammock, he sat up
against the netting. “I didn’t tell you it was
Mother,” he blurted out.</p>

<p>“No,” said Miss Frink quietly. “There
are a number of things you didn’t tell me.”</p>

<p>Hugh felt in his pocket and produced the case.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to tell her things,” said
Millicent—“with an X-ray mind, you know.”</p>

<p>Silently Miss Frink accepted the offered
morocco case, and opened it under Millicent’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she lovely!” exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes. Look at that hair and compare Damaris’s
with it. Does your sister resemble your
mother?” Miss Frink suddenly addressed
Hugh.</p>

<p>His tea-cup jingled in his hand.</p>

<p>“I didn’t—I—yes, she does. You <em>have</em>
been X-raying, Miss Frink. I didn’t tell you
about my sister.”</p>

<p>“No, but Mr. Ogden did. She must be a
very fine woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh regarded the speaker with parted lips.
Was she about to release the sword of Damocles
before these witnesses; or was this all she knew?</p>

<p>“But it will be growing all the time, you see,”
said Millicent; and Miss Frink passed the
photograph to the Colonel. “I wish you’d
let me show you, Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>That lady’s lips twitched and the bright eyes
were very kind as she looked at this girl who
didn’t sprawl, or loll in her chair, and who was
fresh as Aurora.</p>

<p>“Very well, I suppose I must listen to such
a special pleader. I offered the position to Mrs.
Lumbard, but she seemed to think that teaching
music would be more in her line.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see her there,” said Millicent,
shaking her blonde head seriously, “nearly so
well as I can Damaris.”</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, neither can I,” returned
Miss Frink.</p>

<p>“Then—then may I tell her there is hope?”
asked Millicent eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes. You might use it as a bribe to get her
not to tell everybody of Mr. Grimshaw’s coming
around with a search-warrant. Eh?” The
speaker returned the photograph case to its
owner. “It’s time I took this boy home. Have
we some big books to carry, Colonel Duane?”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">ADÈLE</span></h2>

<p>As they entered the carriage, and on the way
home, Hugh waited for some further personal
remarks from his companion, but none came
regarding themselves. Miss Frink declared
herself in favor of pushing through the plans
for Mrs. Lumbard’s recital.</p>

<p>“I should like to get it over with for many
reasons. One is that I feel like a bull in a china
shop when it comes to entertaining. I know no
more about it, nor half so much as my cook.
I rely on you to be host, Hugh.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do the best a clumsy doughboy can;
but there is Mr. Ogden. He knows the ropes
about everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does. I admit that.” Miss Frink
nodded in a way which again made Hugh feel
that the day of reckoning was upon him.
“He’s a smooth rascal!”</p>

<p>Hugh felt profoundly uncomfortable. He
yearned to loose that Damocles weapon himself.
He couldn’t break his promise to Ogden,
but he could relieve himself in an honest remark,
something that would lend some respectability
to the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you going to let me have that job in
the store that I came for, Miss Frink?” he
asked.</p>

<p>She smiled vaguely at the roadside. “Of
course. Let us see. You want to begin at the
sub-basement, and learn how department
stores are constructed.”</p>

<p>Hugh blushed furiously. “Don’t make fun
of me, please. I was packing boxes in a basement
when Mr. Ogden looked me up, for my
family’s sake.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He says he used to be in love with
your sister,” returned Miss Frink composedly;
“but he says so many things besides his
prayers.”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s no doubt about that,” returned
the boy, miserably embarrassed. “It
took some pretty strong impulse to make anybody
take any interest in such a shuffling
proposition as I was.—It seems a year ago,
that day he found me. My hand against every
man, and every man’s hand against me.”</p>

<p>“And he dressed you up in nice clean clothes,
and laid out your programme, and sent you on
your way.”</p>

<p>“Why—he did—but did he tell you so
this morning when you were hobnobbing so
long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Had Ogden laid down the cards without
telling him?</p>

<p>“No,” replied Miss Frink equably. “I
just X-rayed him a little. He was taking all
the credit of your saving my life. I believe he
allowed Providence a small part.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let us forget that, Miss Frink!”
ejaculated the boy. “I’m a chap that’s come
to you for a job, and you are kind enough to
give it to me. I do want to learn the business.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps you will,” was the quiet
reply; “but we’ll wait a bit yet till you can
walk a mile or so and stand up under it. I do
like those Duanes. That little Millicent—I
can’t help calling her little, though she’s as tall
as I am. What a refreshment it is in these days
to find a girl a lady.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you don’t like Ally,” said Hugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t like liars,” returned Miss Frink
calmly.</p>

<p>The boy’s ears grew crimson.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to have been a man,”
she added. “I seem to be out of sympathy
with most things feminine. Mr. Ogden gave
me information concerning Mrs. Lumbard
this morning which lifted a big irritation. It
makes whatever I do for her now a favor instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of a duty. Once, Hugh, I had an honest
friend—just one. There never has been
another. We loved each other. Mrs. Lumbard
came here representing herself as this woman’s
granddaughter, and she called me Aunt Susanna
on the strength of it. Mr. Ogden unconsciously
spoiled her game this morning.
I never had trusted her, and had rebuked myself
for it; but I’m usually right—that X-ray,
you know.”</p>

<p>Hugh, rolling along beside her in the charming
little carriage, wondered wretchedly if she
trusted him, or if the X-ray was working.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for Ally,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>“So am I,” responded Miss Frink promptly.
“I hope she will develop some day into a
worthy woman. I regret that it has to be in
Farrandale, but we can’t have all things to
please us.”</p>

<p>“Some day,” thought Hugh, “she will want
me to be a worthy man, anywhere but in
Farrandale.”</p>

<p>He was in his room dressing for dinner when
Ogden came in.</p>

<p>“Well, admitted to the bar yet?” demanded
the latter gayly.</p>

<p>“Look here, Ogden”—Hugh advanced and
seized his friend. “When you were spilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Ally’s beans this morning, did you spill mine,
too, and never told me?”</p>

<p>“Not so, dear one. Will you kindly not pull
the button off my coat?”</p>

<p>“She acts as if she knew. We were all on the
Duanes’ porch and she asked me to show my
mother’s picture to Miss Duane. How did
she suddenly know it was my mother?”</p>

<p>“Whew!” Whistled Ogden, surprised. “Search
me. I never gave her a clue; but she seemed to
have it in for me for some reason this morning.
Oh,” after a thoughtful moment, “she doesn’t
know! She’s the yea-yea, and nay-nay, kind.
If she knew you were Hugh Sinclair, she would
either say, ‘bless you, my child,’ or tell you to
get off the earth. I know her.”</p>

<p>“I’m growing to know her,” said Hugh,
going on with his toilet, “and I’ll say she’s
a trump. I don’t like to look forward to being
despised by her.”</p>

<p>“Hugh, my son, don’t make me laugh.
You’ve got the woman. I don’t know whether
it’s the shape of your nose or your general air
of having the world by the tail, but the deed’s
done.”</p>

<p>Hugh regarded him gloomily. “All to be
knocked over by a simple twist of the wrist
when she learns that I’m the thing she despises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
most—a liar. She says she has had only one
honest friend. I’d tell her the truth to-night
if it weren’t for Ally’s recital. I don’t want
anything to disturb that, poor girl.”</p>

<p>Under Ogden’s guidance, the invitations to
Mrs. Lumbard’s recital were sent out promptly,
and Farrandale society rose to its first opportunity
to be entertained in the Frink mansion.
Not a regret was received by Miss Frink’s
social secretary <i lang="la">pro tem</i>. Adèle, as the star
of the occasion, took an oddly small part in the
preparations. She did some practicing on her
programme, apologizing to Hugh for its more
weighty numbers.</p>

<p>Leonard Grimshaw observed her infatuation
for the young man, and it added to the score
against him which began on the day Hugh was
carried into the house. Was he in love with
Adèle himself? He sometimes asked himself
the question. She had sparkled into such life
and vivacity in these last days that any man
would have felt her attraction.</p>

<p>One day he found himself alone with her on
the veranda. “Do you realize all Miss Frink
is doing for you in giving this affair?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No. Is it such a great indulgence?” she
returned lightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Positively. It is breaking her habits of
years, and it will be a great expense. She is
making lavish preparations,” declared Grimshaw
severely.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t blame me for it, Leonard,”
said the young woman, reverting to the appealing
manner. “It was Hughie’s idea.”</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake don’t call him ‘Hughie’!”
exclaimed the other irritably. “It makes me
sick. You’re so crazy about him, anyway.”</p>

<p>Adèle smiled up at her companion. “How
delightful! I do believe you’re jealous, Leonard.
I’m complimented to death.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> have far more reason to be jealous,”
he retorted. “Anybody with half an eye can
see that Stanwood is fascinated with Millicent’s
demure ways. ‘In the spring a young
man’s fancy,’ etc., you know, and these walks
with her every day—”</p>

<p>“He has to go to her grandfather,” broke in
Adèle, a frown gathering and quenching the
light in her eyes. “He cares nothing for that
stupid creature except to tease her.”</p>

<p>“And you should care nothing for him,
Adèle,” said Grimshaw quickly. “He is a
crude boy without a cent, just beginning life.
Why waste your time? You are meat for his
masters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>She lifted her head coquettishly, the frown
disappearing. “Are you his master?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Grimshaw.</p>

<p>His regard for Adèle had been deepened
by the fact that Miss Frink was giving this
affair for her. It seemed to prove that she was
more and more a person to be reckoned with,
and likely to share with himself in all his employer’s
favors. Moreover, the young woman’s
attraction to and for Hugh Stanwood had
seemed to create a new eagerness for her in
himself which at moments threatened to overcome
his caution. If Adèle were really to be
one of Miss Frink’s heirs, there was no need
for caution. What worried him was that he
feared that some time he might commit himself
on an uncertainty. Adèle in her present
mood was a menace to clear thinking.</p>

<p>The day of the recital arrived. John Ogden
was here, there, and everywhere. The piano
was freshly tuned. He supervised the removal
of the drawing-room furniture and the placing
of the crowd of camp-chairs. Miss Frink, feeling
invertebrate for the first time in her life, forgot
that he was a smooth rascal, and followed
his suggestions implicitly as to dressing-rooms
and the servants’ duties. Leonard Grimshaw’s
nostrils dilated when his employer informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
him that Mr. Ogden had given instructions to
the caterer and that he, Grim, need feel no
care.</p>

<p>“I think you would find, Miss Frink, that
we could manage this affair if Mr. Ogden were
still in New York,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven he isn’t,” returned that
lady devoutly.</p>

<p>Millicent found it not such an easy matter
to put her employer to sleep to-day. She was
reading the book of an Arctic explorer; and
Miss Frink was learning more about the
astonishing flora of those regions than she
had ever expected to know as the pleasant
voice read on, with an intelligence born of
long assistance to her grandfather’s failing
eyes.</p>

<p>At last Miss Frink flung off the white silk
handkerchief. “It’s no use, Millicent,” she
said. “You know how it is when a young
débutante is taking her first plunge into society.
It’s exciting. I never gave a party before.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it is going to be a wonderful one,”
replied the girl, closing the book on her finger.
“Every one is so pleased to be coming.”</p>

<p>She spoke perfunctorily. Adèle had been
steadying a ladder for Hugh as she crossed the
veranda coming in, and the look on the former’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
face as she gazed up, and he laughed down,
had infuriated her by the sudden heat it brought
on at the back of her own neck.</p>

<p>“How-do, Millicent,” Hugh had cried;
“you’ll have to go home alone to-day. Don’t
you cry!”</p>

<p>She had bowed to Adèle, ignoring his chaff,
and said something pleasant about anticipating
the evening.</p>

<p>“You would think,” she said now, “that
Mrs. Lumbard would be the excited one. How
coolly she takes it.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink shook her pillowed head. “I
think it is nothing in her life to play to a lot of
rubes,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“They won’t care to be taught by her if she
feels that way,” said Millicent stiffly.</p>

<p>Miss Frink laughed. She had learned to
laugh in the last month. “I shouldn’t have
said that. Don’t repeat it and ruin business.
I’m just guessing; but I don’t believe any
kind of an audience would disconcert her.
Have you heard her play?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have a treat in store. As Hugh
says, nobody can hit the box like Ally.”</p>

<p>“Why does he call her Ally?”</p>

<p>“Because of her white hair. When she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
working among the doughboys they called her
an albino.”</p>

<p>“Is she one?” Millicent looked preternaturally
serious.</p>

<p>“Search me,” returned the débutante carelessly.
“Now, look here, Milly, I have another
job for you. I want you to receive with
me to-night.”</p>

<p>“What, Miss Frink?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden says I’ve got to stand up there
by the portières like a black satin post, and
receive the guests as they come in. I thought
I should like to have you and Hugh stand by
me in the ordeal.”</p>

<p>It entertained Miss Frink to see Millicent
blush, and she watched the color come now,
and the startled look in the girl’s eyes, like
that of a bird ready to fly.</p>

<p>“You see,” went on Miss Frink, “somebody
will have to nudge me when I say, ‘Good-evening,
Mr. Griscom; I see you put that deal
over for the Woman’s Club Building!’ ‘Good-evening,
Mr. Bacon; so that rise in real estate
across the river is upon us. Congratulations!’
etc., etc.”</p>

<p>“But I wouldn’t be any good, Miss Frink,
and I—and I couldn’t—it would—for you
to honor Hugh and me together like that—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Frink sighed. “I suppose I should have
to call another town meeting to tell them again
that there was nothing in it. I was saying what
I would <em>like</em> to have; but, as a matter of fact,
Mr. Grimshaw would be very justly hurt if I
planned on Hugh’s supporting me.”</p>

<p>Millicent looked relieved. “Mr. Grimshaw
is just the right one,” she said.</p>

<p>“And you would have no objection to standing
up with him?” Miss Frink’s quizzical
smile was playing about her lips.</p>

<p>The young girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then you put on your prettiest frock and
come and stand beside the old lady, and burst
out with something about the weather if you
hear me mention stocks, bonds, or real estate.”</p>

<p>Millicent went home and told her grandfather
of the high honor thrust upon her. The
responsibility, with that of netting Damaris’s
hair into a demure coiffure for the occasion,
made her all aquiver with excitement.</p>

<p>As soon as she had left Miss Frink that day,
Adèle knocked on her hostess’s door.</p>

<p>“I heard you and Miss Duane talking, so
I knew you were not asleep, Aunt Susanna,”
she said. “I wanted you to see if I look all
right for to-night.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink drew herself up to a sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
posture and regarded her visitor. Adèle looked
like a French marquise, with her snowy hair,
excited color, and eyes sparkling like brown
diamonds. Her white crêpe gown clung to her.</p>

<p>Miss Frink adjusted her glasses and nodded.
“Very picturesque,” she said. “Sit down a
minute, Adèle.”</p>

<p>The latter’s eyes scintillated with swift
apprehension. There was no warmth in her
hostess’s approval.</p>

<p>“What do you wish to say, Aunt Susanna?
Is it about my hair? I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Miss Frink. “We are way
past that.”</p>

<p>Adèle liked the atmosphere less and less.</p>

<p>“Please wait, then,” she said impulsively.
“I don’t want to be thrown off my balance
for to-night.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t
know much about temperamental people,” she
said. “Go on, then. You look very handsome,
Adèle.”</p>

<p>The young woman vanished quickly. Even
Miss Frink said she looked very handsome.
She exulted as she thought of Hugh. His image
constantly filled her thought, and a thousand
imaginings of the future went careering through
her brain.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RECITAL</span></h2>

<p>Of course, Adèle played wonderfully that night.
No anxious to-morrow with Miss Frink ventured
into the rose-color of her dreams. She was
playing to Hugh; and occasionally she caught
his spellbound and admiring eyes. Even the
drop of gall occasioned by the fact that, Millicent’s
duties with the hostess over, Hugh seated
himself beside her to listen, was drowned in the
sweetness of his frank admiration.</p>

<p>The great room was crowded. Miss Frink,
unsmiling and reflective, regarded Adèle with
a calculating eye and ear, absolving herself
from any anxious care for the financial future
of such a one.</p>

<p>To many of the audience this private view,
as it were, of Miss Frink and her home was of
as much or more interest than the programme.
John Ogden, as master of ceremonies, conducted
the affair with grace, and his easy cordiality
among a crowd almost entirely strange to him
was a marvel to Miss Frink, and all her mental
reservations were for the time being submerged
in gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in spite of the interest in the Queen
of Farrandale as a private individual, Hugh
Stanwood was really Exhibit A of the evening:
the man who had saved Miss Frink’s life and
lived in her house ever since. Was Leonard
Grimshaw’s star descending? Was the handsome
youth going to be adopted by his hostess?
Why was Millicent Duane receiving with Miss
Frink? Was Mr. Stanwood really reading law
with her grandfather?</p>

<p>Tongues would wag to-morrow. To-night
they were silenced, first, by the music of—according
to the programme—“Mrs. Adèle
Lumbard, famous pianist of Atlanta, Georgia,”
and later, by a very delicious supper.</p>

<p>A procession of enthusiasts approached
Adèle where she stood in a bay window at the
close of the programme. Leonard Grimshaw
was stationed beside her.</p>

<p>“You are a queen, Adèle,” he murmured
worshipfully, and she let her brown eyes speak
her thanks.</p>

<p>Colonel Duane approached her. “Please
accept my compliments,” he said, bending over
her hand. “You will have all us oldsters practicing
five-finger exercises to-morrow. Here is
Hugh; he is almost bursting with pride that he
knows you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“For a fact, Ally, you outdid yourself,” said
Hugh, taking her hand. “Here is Millicent
fairly afraid to approach such a star.”</p>

<p>“It was perfectly beautiful,” said the young
girl, gazing at her fervently.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” returned Adèle perfunctorily,
looking by her and wondering if she should
have patience to receive the oncoming stream
of people whom Grimshaw formally introduced
one by one ere they dispersed about the house
and out into the grounds.</p>

<p>“I think one party will go a long way with
me, Ogden,” said Miss Frink late in the evening,
hiding a yawn behind her hand.</p>

<p>John Ogden stood beside her as she sped the
parting guests.</p>

<p>When nearly all had gone, Adèle had opportunity
to speak to Hugh: “Take me outdoors.
Let us lose ourselves so I won’t have to
say any more good-nights.”</p>

<p>They slipped away and strolled far out underneath
the great trees.</p>

<p>“A perfect success,” said Hugh.</p>

<p>“Was it?” Adèle leaned wearily on his
arm.</p>

<p>“You will have all Farrandale for pupils if
you want them,” he went on; “but honestly,
Adèle”—he looked down into her upturned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
face—“it’s like hitching a blooded horse to a
coal-wagon to make you teach.”</p>

<p>“You see it, do you?” she returned. “Oh,
how I hate drudgery, Hughie.”</p>

<p>“You must have gone through a lot of it, to
play the way you do.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t realize it. It didn’t seem so. I
liked it.”</p>

<p>Back and forth they strolled in the shadow of
the old elms, Adèle’s cigarette adding its spark
to his among the magic lanterns of fireflies.</p>

<p>“The house looks quiet,” she said at last.
“Let us go in and see if we can find something to
eat. I am nearly starved.”</p>

<p>They crossed the lawn and went up the veranda
steps. In the hall they met the butler,
hanging about aimlessly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lumbard has been neglected, Stebbins,”
said Hugh. “She hadn’t a chance to eat
much of anything. See if you can’t get some
sandwiches and grapejuice for us. Has everybody
gone to bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, when you’ve set out the stuff you go,
too. You can lock up and I’ll see to putting out
the lights.”</p>

<p>The two entered the big dim dining-room and
sat down side by side at the table. For all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Adèle’s protestations of hunger, she only
played with a sandwich and sipped the grapejuice.
So far everything had gone exactly to
suit her. Miss Frink, Leonard Grimshaw, and
Mr. Ogden had all effaced themselves.</p>

<p>She had Hugh to herself in the high-ceiled old
room, and her heart was still exulting in the
incense that had been burned before her all
the evening, incense that was valuable because
Hugh had seen it burning.</p>

<p>Time was flying. This was her great opportunity.</p>

<p>“What are you planning to do with your life,
Hugh?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“I mean to keep on with the law work on the
side while I go into Miss Frink’s store. Don’t
you think you ought to go to bed, Ally? I know
you must be very tired.”</p>

<p>She tossed aside the trivial suggestion with an
impatient motion of her head. “I never sleep
after playing a programme,” she said. Then
she added in a low, appealing voice, her eyes
fixed on his: “I want you to give up that idea,
Hughie. Do you know what wonderful playmates
we are—simply made for each other?”</p>

<p>Hugh began to feel uncomfortable under the
clinging look. “Yes, but life isn’t play,” he
returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would be for us—together. Come to me,
Hughie. You would shrivel up, here. Let us go
away. I will make you happier than you ever
dreamed of being. I love you every second of
every minute, and every minute of every hour.
I—”</p>

<p>“Ally, Ally,” interrupted Hugh gently,
“you’re mistaken. Love begets love, and if you
loved me I should love you. I don’t, and—”</p>

<p>“Stop”—she seized his hand—“I’ll show
you what love is. I will show you what happiness
is. I will take care of the practical side. I
have some money that no one knows of: enough
to start you in business. We will work together,
play together—I can’t live without you,
Hughie, I can’t—”</p>

<p>“Adèle!” It was Miss Frink’s voice. In the
silk negligée she was standing behind them inside
the door.</p>

<p>Adèle sprang to her feet, the brown eyes
flashing their fire directly into Hugh’s as he
rose.</p>

<p>“Speak, Hugh,” she said, excitedly, “before
she has a chance to talk. You know what I have
said, and I mean every word.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t. Now, let us forget it, Ally.”</p>

<p>“No, never; and whatever Miss Frink has
heard she is welcome to remember. Speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Hugh.” There was hysterical appeal in the last
words.</p>

<p>“Then I can only repeat, Ally. Oh, don’t
spoil our friendship!”</p>

<p>“This is enough,” said Miss Frink, coming
forward, and looking Adèle straight in the eyes.
“Why must an artist be a fool?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes others are fools,” cried Adèle,
carried away by her thwarted passion. “The
great Miss Frink is a dupe herself. Hugh has
fooled you as he has fooled me.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink lifted her head. “Do you refer to
the fact that Hugh Stanwood is Hugh Sinclair,
my nephew? That is ancient history.” A moment
of tense stillness while the women’s gaze
still struck a mutual fire. “Will you kindly
leave us, Adèle?”</p>

<p>With a murderous parting look the young
woman obeyed. With only a moment’s hesitation,
and without a glance at Hugh, she dashed
from the room, knocking over a chair in her
flight. Hugh’s gaze was fixed on Miss Frink.
She turned deliberately and faced him. The
look in her eyes, the softness of her lips, were unmistakable
even if she had not extended a hand;
but Hugh had no use for the hand. With one
stride, he reached her, flung his arms around
her and she was held fast in his big embrace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Some sealed door within her, whose firm fastening
had already been weakened, opened gently.
A flood of amazing happiness flowed through,
and softly inundated her whole being.</p>

<p>From the hall came the chime of the Westminster
clock. The four quarters rang; then
through the stillness of the quiet house sounded
the deep, deliberate strokes of the midnight
hour.</p>

<p>Through it all they stood there. Miss Frink
could feel the sobbing catch in the broad chest
to which she was strained.</p>

<p>“I don’t deserve it,” she thought humbly.
“The cross-grained, dominating, selfish, obstinate
woman I have been, to be given this child
of my old age!”</p>

<p>When the last tone died away and intense
stillness reigned again, she spoke:</p>

<p>“Twelve o’clock, and all is well, Hugh. This
is the first time I have been hugged in fifty
years.”</p>

<p>Gently she pushed him from her with hands
that still clung to him. He dropped his arms
and stood looking down at her. She was touched
to see the moisture in the eyes that met hers.</p>

<p>“It is good of you to let me hug you,” he replied
in a low, thick voice.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think you have a lot of explanations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to make,” she said, her kind tone
wavering a little in the intense feeling of the
moment, “but you haven’t. It was all so obvious
after I gained the first clue, that it scarcely
needed your Aunt Sukey’s X-ray mind to see
the whole thing clear as A B C.”</p>

<p>“Don’t use that name!” exclaimed Hugh, as
if it hurt.</p>

<p>“What? Aunt Sukey? Oh, I’ve X-rayed
that, too. I can fully understand the idea of
your great-aunt that you grew up with. I”—a
catch in Miss Frink’s throat stopped her speech
for a second—“I was very unkind to Philip—to
your father. Mr. Ogden knew me, knew that
the only way you could reach my heart was to
smuggle you in; but you got there, Hugh, my
own dear boy, you got there.”</p>

<p>Hugh caught her slender, dry hand in his big
one.</p>

<p>“If I was Aunt Sukey to your father, I am
Aunt Susanna to you, and it was a gift of God
that it was you, yourself, who saved my life
that I might not die before I knew what it is not
to be all alone in the world: what it is to have my
own flesh and blood to love, and perhaps to love
me a little.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Susanna, I don’t feel worthy of your
love,” exclaimed the boy hotly, but softly as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the dark wainscoted walls might have ears. “I
hated it all the time.”</p>

<p>“I know that, too,” returned Miss Frink
quietly.</p>

<p>“What you don’t know,” he continued, “is
how I admire you. You’re the finest woman
I’ve ever known, and the finer you were, and
the more frank, and the more generous, the
more miserable I was. Oh”—shaking his
broad shoulders restlessly—“I’m so glad it’s
over. I want to go away.”</p>

<p>“You want to leave me, Hugh?”</p>

<p>“To pick up my own self-respect somewhere.
I feel as if you couldn’t really trust me!”</p>

<p>“My child”—Miss Frink spoke tenderly—“what
is my boasted X-ray for if I don’t know,
positively, that I <em>can</em> trust you? To lose you, to
have you go away, would leave my life the same
dry husk it was before you came.”</p>

<p>A line grew in Hugh’s forehead, his eyes
dimmed as the two stood looking at each other.
Then he put his arms around her again, and
this time he kissed her.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Prince Charming. How little I
ever expected to have a child to kiss me. Starving,
famished, I was when you came, Hugh, and
didn’t know it.” She pushed him away again
with gentle, firm hands. “Now I want to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a little explaining, myself. To-night I heard
Stebbins stumbling up the servants’ stairs after
everything was quiet, and I felt something was
wrong. I came into the hall and saw that the
lights below were still on. I came down, heard
voices in here, and the rest followed. You
mustn’t feel too unhappy about what happened
to-night. Believe in my X-ray enough to know
that her life has been made up of similar incidents;
not just the same, of course, but the
pursuit of excitement of some sort. I have a
problem now unless she elects to leave Farrandale.”</p>

<p>“Be kind to her, Aunt Susanna!”</p>

<p>“I will, you soft-hearted boy. I imagine a
man finds it the hardest of tasks to turn down a
woman.”</p>

<p>“She said I had fooled her. I don’t know
what she meant.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t either. At that moment it was
a necessity with her to sting, and she stung,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“How did she know—know about me?”
asked Hugh, frowning.</p>

<p>“The same way I did: by the letter she held
in your room addressed to your full name. She
held it for a second under both our eyes. She
thought she had a weapon; but the name did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
not tell her what it told me. She didn’t know
until to-night that you belonged to me.”</p>

<p>“I wish she would leave Farrandale,” said
Hugh restlessly.</p>

<p>“Most women would, under the circumstances.
She belongs to a genus I don’t know
much about. It isn’t safe for me to predict.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re so wonderful,” returned
Hugh, “so big that you will be good to her.”</p>

<p>“I will be if you won’t be,” said Miss Frink,
with her little twitching smile. “You might as
safely try to show affection to a rattlesnake
as to a woman without principle. You can’t
know how or when she’ll strike.”</p>

<p>Hugh walked up and down the room. “Ally’s
such a good fellow. I don’t like—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you don’t; and you may have
to get your wisdom by experience; but she’s a
hard teacher, Experience, Hugh, and she has
given you one big lesson to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’m blessed if I know how I deserved it. I
deserve to be kicked out of the house by you,
but ‘not guilty’ when it comes to Ally.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s eyes followed him adoringly.
It was of no use to try to make him understand.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m pretty tired,” she said at last,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“And I keeping you up!” returned Hugh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
suddenly penitent and stopping in his promenade.</p>

<p>“Débutantes find it rather difficult to go to
sleep when they are tired. This is the first
party I ever gave in my life, Hugh.”</p>

<p>“Never too late to mend,” he returned.</p>

<p>“But sometimes too late to go to bed,” she
answered. “We must look out for that.”</p>

<p>“You go upstairs,” said Hugh. “I told
Stebbins I’d see to the lights. Ally was hungry.
I’ll fix everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she was,” thought Miss Frink, “and
thirsty, too.” But she kept the reflection to
herself. She turned toward the door. “Good-night,”
she said.</p>

<p>Hugh took a long step after her. “Let me tell
you before you go how I thank you: how happy
you have made me!”</p>

<p>She looked up at him sideways. She even had
inspiration to perform a novel act. She threw
the big, earnest, troubled boy a kiss as she vanished
into the hall.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Miss Frink felt
rich—and satisfied with her wealth.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">JOHN OGDEN</span></h2>

<p>John Ogden’s eagle eye had been on Adèle and
Hugh when they slipped out of the house this
evening, and he was well aware that they had
not come in when he persuaded Miss Frink to
seek her couch and leave the disposition of affairs
below-stairs to him. At last, when Stebbins
alone was prowling sleepily about, Ogden
decided that Hugh might become unmanageable
if he found his guardian up and waiting
for him and his lady, as if with rebuke; so he
decided to go to his room. It was scarcely past
eleven o’clock, but, in this household of early
hours, it was late.</p>

<p>Arrived in his room, Ogden opened a window,
turned on the reading-lamp, and taking a book
set himself to listen for his mutinous young
friend. It was not long before he heard the
murmur of voices beneath his window and then
the muffled closing of the house door. He set
his own ajar in order to hear the pair come upstairs.
They did not come. He scowled at his
book and said something between his teeth
which was an aspiration concerning Adèle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Reece. Long minutes passed. He fumed. The
clock on the stairs chimed the half-hour.</p>

<p>By the time the solemn midnight bell fell
upon the quiet house, Ogden had made up his
mind to have nothing more to do with his
protégé. He would leave for New York the
next day, after making a few straight-from-the-shoulder
remarks to Hugh, releasing him from
their partnership. Scowling at his book, he
heard the clock chime another quarter, and,
starting up, went to the door and pulled it
open. The lights were still on. He set his teeth.
He felt his ears burn. It was indecent. He was
humiliated before the chaste image of Miss
Frink. He would wait until the clock chimed
again and then he would go downstairs, no
matter what he came upon. He was determined
to quarrel with Hugh, anyway. It
might as well be to-night as in the morning.</p>

<p>He went back to his book. At the first stroke
of the half-hour, he bounded to the door and
opened it once more. All was dark below.
Hugh’s room was near his. He went to it. The
brilliantly lighted transom was open. He
knocked softly on the door and opened it.
Hugh, turning about, faced a gentleman in his
shirt-sleeves with a scarlet face, rumpled hair,
and a generally wild and angry appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anything wrong, Mr. Ogden?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong!” John Ogden was speechless.
He had never seen Hugh look like this.
The boy’s face was alive with—was it hope?
It was certainly gladness, satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’ve been frank with you, Hugh,” he said
in a lowered voice; then to be more certain that
there was no eavesdropping, Ogden turned and
closed the transom. “I told you she was a
person of no principle, knowing no law but her
own will, and, to say nothing of the bad taste
and danger of playing with such a woman, you
risk outraging Miss Frink’s strict ideas of decorum
by staying down there alone all this
time. I’m thoroughly disgusted. I must be
honest. Right at the time when you are wanting
to disclose yourself, to have you play the
fool like this, it’s painfully disappointing. That’s
what it is, painfully disappointing. I shall
leave for New York to-morrow, and you can
conduct your affairs to suit yourself.”</p>

<p>The effect of this intense speech on his listener
surprised Ogden even while he was delivering
it. Was Hugh so fatuous, so impervious?</p>

<p>The boy, smiling and looking exasperatingly
handsome and happy, seized the smaller man
and pulled him down beside him on the couch
at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is true,” he said. “I’ve been party of the
second part in a love-scene downstairs, and I
owe it all to you, Ogden.” Hugh threw an arm
around his companion’s shoulders. “I’ll never,
never forget it.”</p>

<p>Ogden with open mouth stared into the violet
eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s Aunt Susanna. I’ve been hugging Aunt
Susanna.”</p>

<p>Ogden went limp. He still stared. He
brushed his hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>Hugh laughed low. “Yes; she’s known it ever
since Ally held that letter of Carol’s in her lap;
and she forgives us, and she understands.”</p>

<p>“What—where—when did you exchange
Ally for Miss Frink?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Susanna couldn’t understand the
lights, and she came downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Where—where is Ally?” asked Ogden,
still stunned.</p>

<p>“Asleep, I suppose,” Hugh sobered.</p>

<p>“Intact, then?” Ogden looked questioning.</p>

<p>“Of course. She shared in the big surprise.
Aunt Susanna told her I was her nephew—Ally
had seen Carol’s letter, too.”</p>

<p>Ogden’s alert brain grasped the possible
scene. “Ah! Perhaps she had thought that she
was the one to provide the surprise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Hugh vaguely; then impulsively,
“Don’t go home, Ogden. Stay and
be happy with us awhile. I told Aunt Susanna
I wanted to go away, but the idea seemed to
hurt her.”</p>

<p>John Ogden began to nurse his knee, and
rock back and forth reflectively, keeping up
occasional bursts of low, nervous laughter.</p>

<p>“It won’t hurt her to have <em>me</em> go away,” he
said. “That explains all those side-winders and
innuendoes. Ha, ha, it is a good joke on the
lady. It gives her the nettle-rash that I got
away with it, at the same time that she’s glad of
it.” Ogden’s eyes were bright as he continued
to consider. “And Grimshaw! Oh, Grimshaw!
Draw a veil.” At this, his laughter threatened
to grow violent. He buried his face in the satin
cushions.</p>

<p>The secretary awoke the morning after the
recital with a confused but happy sense that
the world was a pleasant place to live in. He
had not sounded many of its pleasures, and it
was time he began. What a wonderful companion
in all that was gay, in all of life that he
had avoided, was the niece of his employer, the
talented young creature about whom all Farrandale
would be talking to-day!</p>

<p>How quietly and demurely Adèle had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the adulation of last evening: creeping off
modestly to her room at the last, without even
a good-night. Where had Stanwood been at the
time? Grimshaw frowned a little in his effort to
remember where Stanwood had been while the
guests were departing. John Ogden had stood
beside Miss Frink while the good-byes were
being said. He, himself, had had too much to
attend to in supervising the departure of the
caterer’s retinue, and other household movements.
He gave it up finally. Probably Hugh
had been with the Duanes. Grimshaw had
never liked Millicent since her mild defiance of
him in the matter of taking the records to the
White Room. A suggestion from any one that
he was not in full authority in Miss Frink’s
house put the culprit in his black books.</p>

<p>Getting out of bed, he now crossed the room
and observed a white folded paper pushed beneath
his door. He picked it up, opened it, and
read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Leonard</span>: A strange thing came to my
knowledge last night, and, fearing that it may be
a shock to you to learn it, I thought I would prepare
you and I hope you will not consider it presumptuous
on my part. If it does seem so, pardon
me, because it is only my solicitude for you. It
seems that Hugh Stanwood’s real name is Sinclair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and that he is a nephew of Miss Frink.
She will doubtless tell you immediately her discovery
of his identity; and we shall see if she
resents his obtaining entrance to her under a
false name.</p>

<p class="center">Yours ever</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Adèle</span></p>

</div>

<p>The secretary’s face became scarlet as he
read. The shock was all his friend could have
anticipated, and he felt grateful to her for the
preparation. This interloper and liar to have
had the damned luck to save Miss Frink’s life;
to command her gratitude and regard! There
was the chance now that his duplicity might
antidote that gratitude. Grimshaw’s face became
more hopeful as the thought grew. He
saw Miss Frink, in her intolerance of falsity,
sending the fellow about his business. Happy
dénouement to the past afflicting weeks.
Adèle was a sweet girl. Her thought was all of
him, and for his protection.</p>

<p>At the same moment in another room another
gentleman was finding a folded paper on the
polished wood of his threshold. Opening it he
read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I am not responsible after playing. I am intoxicated,
and a woman is as liable to tell the truth in
her cups as a man. Can you forgive and forget,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Hugh? You can imagine how deeply I regret that
hysterical outburst. Be generous to me.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Adèle</span></p>

</div>


<p>Hugh frowned as he read. Poor Adèle!
What lay before her now? He dreaded to meet
her at breakfast, and hoped that she would decide
to leave Farrandale. Ogden had assured
him, before they parted last night, that she had
no more idea of teaching in this town than she
had of flying to the moon.</p>

<p>Adèle did not come to breakfast, and, as for
Ogden, it took some hardihood for him to present
himself to his hostess that morning. His
gay, debonair look was the same as usual when
she greeted him. She was already seated behind
the coffee percolator when he came in, and,
instead of going to his place, he came to her and
held out his hand, with an odd chuckle.</p>

<p>“I’m as nervous as a cat this morning,” he
said, meeting her bright eyes.</p>

<p>After a little hesitation she gave him her
hand for a quick shake. “What is it: your conscience
or your digestion?” she inquired.</p>

<p>Leonard Grimshaw was in his place watching
their every move as a cat watches a mouse; and
here Hugh came into the room. He, too, approached
Miss Frink’s chair, and she held his
hand while she addressed her secretary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Leonard,” she began—and it was only in
her most serious moments that she thus addressed
him—“I have a great surprise for you.
This young man who put me under such obligation
and to whom we are so much attached,
is my grand-nephew, Hugh Sinclair. I have
known it only a short time.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw felt that but for Adèle’s warning
he should have collapsed. As it was, he turned
pale under the discovery of his employer’s attitude
toward the culprit.</p>

<p>“I suppose <em>he</em> knew it,” he returned, with a
carefully respectful manner.</p>

<p>“Yes, he knew it,” returned Miss Frink,
smiling up at Hugh and still retaining the hand
that clasped hers closely.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he tell us sooner?” asked
Grimshaw politely.</p>

<p>“Pretty good aim,” reflected Ogden.</p>

<p>“Because he thought of me as an old dragon,”
returned Miss Frink. “We don’t beat about the
bush in this matter any more than in any other.
Go and sit down, Hugh, and I’ll give you a
really good cup of coffee.”</p>

<p>The boy obeyed, scarlet humiliation upon
him again. He knew the secretary’s thoughts.
He knew what would leak out all through Farrandale,
and that no one would ever realize how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
he had hated it. He gave a glowering look at
Ogden.</p>

<p>That gentleman spoke up cheerfully. “That
was my doing, Mr. Grimshaw, that feature of
the matter, not telling Miss Frink at first. Mr.
Sinclair would have infinitely preferred telling
her at once, and I think the full explanation of
my not being crippled for life lies in the fact
that he has been bedridden and weak; but my
motto is always, ‘All’s well that ends well.’
Isn’t it yours, too, Mr. Grimshaw?”</p>

<p>“Has it ended?” returned the secretary, as
lightly as he was able.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">A PARTING INTERVIEW</span></h2>

<p>Although Miss Frink had presented herself so
promptly at breakfast that morning, she had
been as sleepless as Adèle. Waves of wonder
and joy had passed over her in the consideration
of her happiness, and kept her awake.
That honest boy—honest in spite of the part
he had been induced to play—admired her,
loved her. He had said so, and she believed
him. She had not thought her life empty before,
but now she felt compassion for her past. Her
brain seethed with plans and possibilities, and
certain charitable institutions lost a great deal
of money that night.</p>

<p>As she thought thus, the remembrance of
Adèle clouded the radiance of her reflections.
She had yet this problem to meet. If the young
woman would solve it by leaving town, what a
mercy it would be! Of course, she had fallen in
love with Hugh, head over heels. So, thought
Miss Frink, sighing, would probably every
girl who met him; but Adèle had hazarded all,
tried to rush the boy off his feet, and, if she had
known that he was related to Miss Frink, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
would not have deterred her. Her sort fears
neither God nor man. Miss Frink shrank into
her pillow and closed her sleepless eyes as she
recalled Adèle’s bitter attitude toward herself,
and the young woman’s triumphant hope of
wounding her.</p>

<p>Miss Frink was a strong woman; but her excitement
as she dressed that morning was not
sufficient to lift her above her sense of weariness.
Explaining the situation to Leonard
Grimshaw was before her. It rankled that he
would believe her splendid boy to be blameworthy.
Then there was John Ogden to be met,
and, looming dark above all these, was Adèle to
be dealt with. She had been intending to have
a final talk with Adèle this morning in any
case; so, when the waitress at last went up to
Mrs. Lumbard’s room with her breakfast, she
carried a message that Miss Frink would come
in to see her at ten o’clock.</p>

<p>“Pleasant prospect!” thought Adèle as she
sat up in bed to receive the tray. “Thank you,
Janet,” she said sweetly to the maid.</p>

<p>“You look awful tired, Mrs. Lumbard,”
said the girl, “and so does Miss Frink. There’s
all sorts of doings down in the breakfast room.”
Janet’s eyes were big. “What do you think!
Mr. Stanwood’s name is something else and he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
some sort of relation to Miss Frink all this
time, and nobody knew it!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Janet?” Adèle put the cream
in her coffee.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” returned the excited girl.
“Stebbins heard Miss Frink say so herself to
Mr. Grimshaw.”</p>

<p>“Did Miss Frink seem pleased?” Adèle
broke off a piece of toast, speaking languidly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed, and holding his hand.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Grimshaw’s?” Adèle smiled wanly.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Stanwood’s; and she seemed so
happy over it.”</p>

<p>“Who wouldn’t be happy holding Mr. Stanwood’s
hand?”</p>

<p>Janet giggled. “Yes, ain’t he awful handsome?—and
now he’ll be the biggest catch in
Farrandale; but I guess there won’t any o’ the
girls have a chance when you’re around, Mrs.
Lumbard.”</p>

<p>Janet’s head fell to one side in sentimental
admiration as she regarded Adèle.</p>

<p>The latter smiled and nodded at her: “You’d
better run along, Janet.”</p>

<p>The maid disappeared, and Adèle again
clamped down the lid on the humiliating memories
of last evening. She must not be humiliated
when Miss Frink came in. She remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the violence of her own attack upon that
lady and regretted it as most unwise; nevertheless,
her head might be “bloody,” but it
should be “unbowed.” It had been quite evident
for some time that Miss Frink’s hospitality
was being strained; Adèle could not in any
case have hoped to remain here much longer.
Why should she be ashamed of loving Hugh?
Why should she be ashamed of trying to get
him? She was not. It was all in the game. She
had lost for the present, but who could tell?</p>

<p>By the time Miss Frink’s knock sounded on
the door, the young woman was dressed and
ready to open it with an attempt at a smile.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Aunt Susanna.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Adèle.” Miss Frink regarded
the calm face and unfallen eyes uncomfortably;
and felt her own self-possession
strengthened by such control.</p>

<p>“Well,” she began, as they sat down in neighboring
chairs, “we have come to the parting of
the ways, Adèle.”</p>

<p>“Have we? Where are you going?” was the
astonishing reply.</p>

<p>Miss Frink grimaced her glasses off the eyes
beneath which were dark shadows, and at once
replaced them.</p>

<p>“You certainly help me not to beat about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
bush,” she said. “I thought perhaps last night’s
experience would make you feel you did not
care to stay in Farrandale.”</p>

<p>“After your giving such an expensive advertisement
for me?” Adèle smiled.</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s own deep happiness embarrassed
her. Hugh’s earnest “Be kind to Ally,” rang in
her ears. This adventuress, pale and defiant,
seemed to her so pitiful that, in spite of the
other’s audacity, she had to summon her customary
directness with an effort.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be good economy, would it?”
added Adèle.</p>

<p>There was a pause; then Miss Frink spoke
again: “I must tell you that I have discovered,
quite by accident, that you are not the granddaughter
of my dear friend. Her son married a
lady with a little girl, a little pianist.”</p>

<p>Color stole over Adèle’s pallor.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Ogden is a regular god in the machine,
isn’t he?” she said lightly. “Delightful
man!”</p>

<p>“My informant was unaware that he was
telling me any news,” went on Miss Frink;
“but, this being the case, I feel that it would be
rather foolish for us to keep up the pose of aunt
and niece.”</p>

<p>“Especially,” returned Adèle “since you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
have found some one with the right of blood to
call you ‘Aunt Susanna.’”</p>

<p>Miss Frink regarded her composed companion
in silence. Not with her could she exchange
words concerning her heart-warming miracle.</p>

<p>“A few days ago,” she said, “I obtained the
refusal for you of a room at the Coopers’: cousins
of Leonard’s. If you decide to stay in Farrandale,
he will take you over there to-day and
introduce you. Mrs. Cooper is ready for you to
take possession at any minute. They have a
very good piano.”</p>

<p>“I thought,” said Adèle, with unabashed
eyes, “that I should like to go to the Duanes’.
I hear they have such a pleasant garden, and I
believe they are poor and might like a paying
guest.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink regarded her incredulously. Was
there, then, no limit to her audacity?</p>

<p>“Colonel Duane was very nice to me last evening,”
added Adèle. “Such a courtly old gentleman.”</p>

<p>“They keep no maid and would not take any
one,” said Miss Frink briefly.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be any trouble, for I would help
Miss Duane like one of the family.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink felt a sort of horror of the smooth,
fair speaker. She had been prepared to be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
kind to the poor woman who had blundered so
pitifully, but her own assurances to Hugh came
back to her: the occurrence was no tragedy to
Mrs. Lumbard, evidently to her while there
was life, there was hope. To suggest going to
the Duanes’! The image of Millicent rose before
Miss Frink as the antithesis of all that
Adèle represented.</p>

<p>The latter smiled now, wan, but still unembarrassed.</p>

<p>“If you are thinking that it will be awkward
for me to meet Hugh, you are mistaken. He
hasn’t lived all his life in a small town. He
knows his way about. No man ever thought
less of a woman for caring a lot for him, and
Hugh and I will always be pals. I don’t think
any the less of him for coming into your house
under false colors. He carried his point.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s cheeks flushed. “Why, indeed,
should you criticize him? You did the same.”</p>

<p>“Only I didn’t carry my point. You never
liked me.”</p>

<p>“Nor were you really my niece,” said Miss
Frink briefly. “Adèle,” she added—and there
was appeal in her voice—“in this nine days’
wonder that is coming upon Farrandale I wish
that, for the sake of such hospitality as I have
shown you, you would help to give the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
explanation of Hugh’s manner of introducing
himself here. It was Mr. Ogden’s idea entirely,
inasmuch as I had not been friendly to Hugh’s
family. The sequel you know.”</p>

<p>Adèle’s stolid expression did not change, and
she did not speak.</p>

<p>Miss Frink sat, looking at her and waiting.</p>

<p>“The truth generally comes out about everything,”
said the young woman at last.</p>

<p>“Adèle, Adèle,” said Miss Frink solemnly.
“Why won’t you try to make your life measure
up to the beauty of your art? What I heard
last evening will be buried forever, as you know,
unless you yourself force a remembrance of it.”
She looked at her watch. “Leonard will take
you over to Mrs. Cooper’s as soon as you are
ready.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink went out and closed the door.
For the first time in her life she quivered with
feeling. Her cheeks were flushed.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairway she met John
Ogden.</p>

<p>“Just the lady I want to see!” he cried cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Very well—my benefactor,” she said
slowly.</p>

<p>“Do my ears deceive me? How good that
sounds!” He seized both her hands for a quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
moment. Her flushed face and subdued tone
impressed him.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re very tired, Miss Frink.
Too much excitement, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Yes; in this world we must accept the bitter
with the sweet, but—nothing is any matter.
What did you want of me?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m leaving for New York to-night,
and I wish to ask a privilege before I go. I’ve no
doubt there are numbers of gentle-folk in Farrandale,
but I happen to have made the acquaintance
of only two: Colonel Duane and his
granddaughter. Tongues are going to buzz for
a while now, and I would like to beat the gossips
to it with those fine people. I should like to tell
them my own part in what has taken place.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I have no objection. Open confession
is good for the soul.” Miss Frink smiled
wearily.</p>

<p>“Now you go to bed, Miss Frink. Please
do. Let Grimshaw run the city of Farrandale
to-day.”</p>

<p>“He is very soon going to escort Mrs. Lumbard
to her new abiding-place at Mrs. Cooper’s.”</p>

<p>“That will rest you, eh?” asked Ogden appreciatively.
“She really intends to stay here
and teach the young idea?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. Perhaps I ought not to let
her,” returned Miss Frink, and her companion
saw her hold her lip under her teeth to still its
quivering. “I seem to be sponsoring her, you
see.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Frink, don’t you worry,” returned
Ogden, speaking low but emphatically,
for they were still standing at the foot of the
stairs. “Don’t worry a minute. She won’t stick
to that teaching a month.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink gave him a rather tremulous
smile of gratitude; and, before Ogden took his hat
to run out on his errand, he went up to Hugh’s
room where the latter was busy with his books.</p>

<p>“Say, boy,” he said, “I’ve just come from
Miss Frink, and she had just come from a talk
with your friend Ally; and I tell you she was
all in.”</p>

<p>Hugh wheeled around in his chair and fixed a
troubled look on his friend.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Frink looked old and tired. Her
pep was gone. Mrs. Re—Lumbard is leaving
to-day, it seems.”</p>

<p>“Leaving Farrandale?” asked Hugh, with an
eagerness which his friend misunderstood.</p>

<p>“No; don’t be afraid. I think Miss Frink is
worrying about her being turned loose among
the Farrandale lambs; and I just want to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Hugh, that if you continue to pal with Mrs.
Lumbard you’ll make a great mistake from
every point of view. You owe it to Miss Frink
to ease off and not encourage her. Miss Frink
doesn’t want her coming here.”</p>

<p>Hugh continued his troubled stare. “I hope
you didn’t tell her the damaging thing you told
me—about the courts.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Ogden impatiently;
“but Miss Frink has the woman’s number all
right. I don’t know what their good-bye talk
was like, but this fine aunt of yours came out of
it wounded. I tell you she was wounded; and
you want to think of her and protect her, boy.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to, Ogden. Thank you,” replied
Hugh, with a submissiveness that surprised his
friend.</p>

<p>John Ogden stared at him for a silent moment.
“Well, then,” he said, vaguely, and
left the room.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">PAVING THE WAY</span></h2>

<p>Ogden went on thinking about the unusual docility
with which Hugh had received his exhortation.
Also there was the devotion to his studies
at a moment when Ally was about to depart
from the house. How about that?</p>

<p>As he swung along he began to smile, his retrospective
reflection visualizing that slipping
away into the moonlight which he had witnessed
and worried over last evening. After a
minute in a rush of thought his smile broadened.
It seemed probable that the siren, in the excited
reaction from her performance, might
have thrown a scare into the heir apparent. At
what juncture had she slipped away from
Hugh’s arm and Miss Frink slipped into it?
Something had gone on, to flush Miss Frink’s
cheeks and weary her eyes this morning. All the
time that he himself was reading and fretting in
his room last evening, things had been happening
downstairs. Anyway, the net result had
been a joyous one, as transpired unmistakably,
later.</p>

<p>As Ogden tramped along, he was roused from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
his reverie to realize that many persons he met
greeted him. Realizing that they remembered
him as the busy master of ceremonies on the
night before, he responded cordially, and at last
a short man in a checked suit forced him to a
standstill by his effusive manner.</p>

<p>“Goldstein, Mr. Ogden. I. K. Goldstein.
We had but a minute’s talk last night—”</p>

<p>“Ah, good-morning, Mr. Goldstein.” Ogden
endeavored to edge away from the plump hand
with the diamond ring, after yielding to its determined
grasp.</p>

<p>“I cannot let you go without speaking again
of that won-derful evening. Such an artist you
have there, that Mrs. Lumbard; she is amazing.
In a town the size of Farrandale we are all one
family. You put us all under obligation bringing
such an artist here!”</p>

<p>“Oh, not I at all; Miss Frink—”</p>

<p>“Miss Frink! Oh, she is the genius of our
city!” Mr. Goldstein made known by gestures
and upturned eyes that Miss Frink’s glories
were indescribable. “You come any time to see
me, Mr. Ogden, and I wish you would bring
Miss Frink, and I show you both all over the
Koh-i-noor, our theater—”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Goldstein, but I am leaving
town to-night—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“But can’t you spare a little time, a half an
hour this afternoon?—it is a palace equal to
any in the country. An organ—oh, such an organ
I have installed!—we open in less than a
month; you would be happy to see those velvet
furniture in the lobby.”</p>

<p>“No doubt I should; but I have—”</p>

<p>“That young man at your house, the one
who saved our wonderful Miss Frink’s life, he
should be in the pictures, you must see that.
There’s the story right there, too. I give him
introductions; you send him to me.”</p>

<p>John Ogden disengaged the clinging hand from
his lapel as best he could, and, mindfully thanking
the manager of the Koh-i-noor, contrived to
escape with an apology for his pressing business.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldstein called after him cordially as
long as he could hear.</p>

<p>Millicent Duane, enveloped in an apron, had
brought out some vegetables to prepare for the
noon dinner and was sitting on the porch with a
large tin pan in her lap.</p>

<p>Her grandfather, who had been as usual
working about the garden, finally came slowly
up the steps and sank restfully into his favorite
chair with the calico cushion.</p>

<p>“I can’t get that last piece she played out of
my head,” he said. “Mrs. Lumbard said it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a <i lang="fr">Marche Militaire</i>. I should say so.” The
speaker drummed the rhythm on the arms of
his chair.</p>

<p>“It was splendid,” agreed Millicent. She had
been hearing all the morning about the recital,
and the English “fed up” but faintly described
her satiation.</p>

<p>The morning was so beautiful, the birds so
tuneful, everything that had not unfolded was
so busy unfolding, and the air so full of sweetness,
Millicent could not understand why she
felt at odds with a world that was so amiably
putting its best foot forward. She forced herself
to respond with ardor to her grandfather’s comments.
She was glad he had had such an unusual
treat. He had seen nothing but charm in
Mrs. Lumbard’s manner; while Millicent still
felt the perfunctoriness of the star’s response to
her own effort to express her appreciation. Hugh
had been beside her at the time, and as usual
Mrs. Lumbard had implied, or at least Millicent
felt the implication, that she was negligible, and
the sooner she effaced herself the sooner could
life really go on. And it had gone on. The stinging
remembrance was that, before the Duanes
left, Millicent had seen Hugh and the star disappear
together. The girl’s annoyance, and resentment
that she could feel it, made her an extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
lively and agreeable companion to her grandfather
on the way home. He remarked affectionately
on the good the evening had done her,
and how she needed such outings; and she
laughed and hugged him, then went to bed,
strains of music flowing through her hot head,
while her wet eyes buried in the pillow still saw
the moonlight sifting through the great trees
with their black shadows, shadows through
which <em>they</em> were walking. She wanted—she
knew now how desperately she wanted—to
walk in the moonlight with Hugh herself, and
her feeling that it was a contemptible wish did
not help the situation in the least.</p>

<p>Now, this morning, she sat there, enveloped
in her pink checked apron, the bright tin pan in
her lap and her hands busy, while her grandfather
watched her fleeting smiles.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you look sort of pale this morning,
honey,” he said.</p>

<p>“Dissipation,” she returned. “You know
I’m a country girl.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t late,” he returned reminiscently,
still evidently enjoying his memories. “How
she did play the ‘Spring Song’! Simplest things
are the best, aren’t they, Milly? I think you
look sweeter in that pink apron than in your
party dress,” he added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t I look nice last night?” asked the
girl with unexpected gravity.</p>

<p>“I should say so. Quite the up-to-date girl,
standing there with Miss Frink in her august
dignity.”</p>

<p>“Grandpa, here comes Mr. Ogden.”</p>

<p>Colonel Duane rose as the caller opened the
gate, and came to the head of the steps to meet
him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you move now, Miss Millicent,” said
Ogden as the girl started to put aside the big
pan. “You make the most charming domestic
picture.”</p>

<p>“I can’t shake hands,” she returned, as he
approached, and her cheeks matched the gay
hue of her apron while her eyes welcomed him.</p>

<p>“This is my P.P.C.” he remarked, taking the
chair Colonel Duane offered.</p>

<p>“Oh, are you leaving us?” asked the old
gentleman, returning to his calico cushion. “I
don’t know what they’ll do without you at Miss
Frink’s. That was a great treat she gave us last
night. We haven’t talked about anything else
this morning; and your announcements, and
the general pleasant informality with which you
managed the occasion, gave it the last touch of
charm. How is that delightful, bright particular
star, this morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Lumbard? I haven’t seen her. She
didn’t come down to breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Well, she certainly earned that luxury,” responded
the Colonel, while Millicent’s gaze fell
demurely to her busy hands. “I’d like to have
Milly take some lessons of her,” he added.</p>

<p>The girl flashed a quick glance up at the caller.
“But I’m not going to,” she said. “You can’t
teach an old dog new tricks.”</p>

<p>The men laughed.</p>

<p>“What makes you go away, Mr. Ogden?”
she added.</p>

<p>“Oh, life can’t be all Farrandale, you know.
There’s business waiting for me over there in
the suburb of New York. I only came to see
Hugh because he was ill.”</p>

<p>“Hugh seemed quite proud of his brilliant
friend last night,” remarked the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Oh!” thought Millicent, “will he ever get
through talking about her!”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t blame him if he lost his heart—so
handsome and so talented she is.”</p>

<p>Down went the young girl’s gaze again to the
contents of her pan.</p>

<p>John Ogden saw the compression of her soft
lips.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lumbard is leaving Miss Frink to-day
also,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent looked up quickly again.</p>

<p>“Why is that? Not leaving Farrandale, I
hope,” said the Colonel.</p>

<p>“No. I heard some one say something about
the Coopers’. Of course, Mrs. Lumbard has
only been visiting Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>“The Coopers’!” echoed Millicent. “Is Mrs.
Lumbard going to live at the Coopers’?”</p>

<p>Ogden shrugged his shoulders. “Don’t quote
me. I may be all off, but I understood that.”</p>

<p>“Of course, they are Mr. Grimshaw’s cousins,”
said the girl reflectively.</p>

<p>“Another one of her satellites,” remarked the
old gentleman, smiling. “It was easy to see
last evening that Grimshaw’s steady head was
all off its balance. I don’t believe you attractive
bachelors are going to let that charmer
teach very long. One of you will snatch her
up.”</p>

<p>“I had to leave her to my rivals last night,”
said Ogden. “I probably lost out for good.”</p>

<p>Millicent’s grave large gaze was upon him,
trying to discover whether he was serious. She
liked Mr. Ogden, but she would have been perfectly
willing he should snatch up Mrs. Lumbard.</p>

<p>“You’re quite a matchmaker, Colonel,” he
went on. “I don’t know how that rosebud over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
there behind the tin pan escapes your machinations.”</p>

<p>Millicent threw a glance over her shoulder in
evident search for the rosebud, and Ogden
laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, she,” returned the old man regarding
the girl with eyes of placid love; “she has a
heart like a flint. We have a lot of the nicest
boys you’d ever care to know, in Farrandale.
She used to like them, Milly did. When she was
in the store, I used to have to complain of the
way she let them bother around and keep her up
late; but now she has left the store, and could
sleep in the morning if she wanted to, she won’t
have a thing to do with them. They can’t do
anything right. One laughs too loud, one brings
his mandolin and she hates it, one parts his
hair in the middle, and they all varnish their
locks—”</p>

<p>“Grandpa!” Millicent interrupted him with
rather unnecessary severity, Ogden thought.
“I don’t like to be discussed.”</p>

<p>Her grandfather laughed toward her affectionately,
and raised his eyebrows. “Gracious!”
he exclaimed. “What a grown-up baby
I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must get at my business,” said the
visitor. “I came this morning, not only to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
good-bye, but to let you nice people be the
first to know something concerning our friend
Hugh.”</p>

<p>Millicent’s collection of knives hit the tin pan
and clattered to the floor. The pan so nearly
fell after it that Ogden, springing forward,
caught it just in time. The girl’s hands trembled
as she grasped it, and murmured some inarticulate
thanks.</p>

<p>“Ah, many a true word spoken in jest,” said
the Colonel. “That is why the lovely pianist is
leaving Miss Frink’s; but conventionality can
be carried too far, I think.”</p>

<p>John Ogden was busy restoring Millicent’s
goods, wares, and chattels to her lap, and he
camouflaged her tremor by laughing allusion to
Uncle Remus, and Brer Rabbit’s clatter with his
seben tin plates, and seben tin cups.</p>

<p>“No, nothing of that kind, Colonel Duane,”
he said as he took his chair again. “This is a
story that I will make brief. Long ago there was
a feud in Miss Frink’s small family.”</p>

<p>Millicent tried to moisten her dry lips, and
ceased attempting to use the knife which
seemed determined to beat a rat-a-plan against
the side of the pan.</p>

<p>“She had a nephew, Philip Sinclair, whom
she loved; but his opposition to her plans for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
him angered her to such a degree that it made a
complete break. She never met his wife or
children, and refused to know them. I was a
friend of that family, and Hugh was one of the
children. When he returned from the war, I
hunted him up.”</p>

<p>Ogden glanced at Millicent. She was leaning
back in her chair, her lips parted, her face very
pale, and her eyes full upon him. He looked
back at once to Colonel Duane, who was giving
him similar fixed attention.</p>

<p>“When I met Hugh, whom I had last seen as
a child, you can understand what an impression
he made on me, and how I thought of his lonely
great-aunt whom I had come to know well in
the way of business. Hugh was alone, and drifting,
like so many of the returned boys, and a
scheme came into my head which I suggested to
him. It was to come here with a letter of introduction
from me, and, using only his first two
names, Hugh Stanwood, apply to Miss Frink
for a job in Ross Graham Company. I knew
there was no hope of her receiving him if she
knew he was the son of the man who had so
bitterly disappointed and offended her, and I
trusted to his winning her esteem before the
truth came out. I had a lot of difficulty in getting
Hugh’s consent to this, but at last I succeeded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
I fitted him out for the experiment,
which, of course, put him under some obligation
to me: an obligation which was my weapon to
hold him to our compact. He has had times of
hating me, because Hugh is essentially honest;
and the remarkable coincidence which threw
him into his aunt’s house as a guest, instead of
allowing him to be an employe in her store,
gave him many a weary hour of thought which
he used mostly for condemnation of me and himself.
I came on as soon as I learned of his illness,
and found that Miss Frink had become very
fond of the boy. When she at last experienced
the shock of discovering who he was, she suspected
me at once as being the instigator of the
plan, and for a time she was torn: undecided as
to whether I should be cannonaded or canonized.
I judge she has decided on the latter
course, for this morning she called me her benefactor.”</p>

<p>Ogden paused.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” said Colonel Duane. “I’ll
warrant the old lady is happy.”</p>

<p>Millicent said nothing; just gazed.</p>

<p>“My reason for coming to tell you this”—Ogden
addressed Millicent now—“is that, as
the affair is known and discussed, Hugh is going
to be misunderstood and condemned. Thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
disagreeable things are going to be said
about him. He is going to be called a fortune-hunter.”</p>

<p>“He was, wasn’t he?” broke in Millicent suddenly.</p>

<p>“I was. It was I. Please remember that. I
exacted from him at the time a promise that he
would not reveal their relationship to Miss
Frink until I gave him permission; so, chafe as
he might and did, he kept that promise. He’s a
fine youngster; and to my relief and pleasure
his aunt realizes it, and they understand each
other.”</p>

<p>Colonel Duane nodded and smiled. “A story
that ends well. Eh, Milly?”</p>

<p>She assented with another of the fleeting
smiles. This change in Hugh’s fortunes put him
still farther away. No one could tell to what
lengths Miss Frink’s pride and joy would go,
and what advantages now awaited him.</p>

<p>“What did you say Hugh’s name is?” asked
the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Sinclair. Hugh Stanwood Sinclair, and one
of the finest,” returned Ogden. “I hope I have
set him right in your eyes and that you will defend
him as occasion arises.”</p>

<p>“We’re fond of Hugh,” returned the old gentleman
quietly, “and I don’t think you need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
dread unkind comments on him. You know the
way of the world, and Miss Frink’s handsome
heir is going to be <i lang="la">persona grata</i> to everybody,
except, perhaps”—Colonel Duane laughed—“Leonard
Grimshaw.”</p>

<p>Ogden smiled. “The nephew was introduced
to him this morning at breakfast; and, except
for a look which endangered the sweetness of
the cream, he took it very calmly.”</p>

<p>After the caller had departed, Colonel Duane
came back to his chair.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he said. “So the hero wasn’t
called Prince Charming for nothing, was he?
A story that ends well. Eh, Milly? He’ll grace
the position, eh? I like the idea. Indeed, I do.
Isn’t it fine?”</p>

<p>And Millicent said it was, and gathered up
her paraphernalia and went into the house.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">ADJUSTMENTS</span></h2>

<p>As soon as she had parted from John Ogden,
Miss Frink went to her study. Her secretary
was in his place. Could this possibly be the
world of the barren yesterdays? The same
world in which she and Leonard Grimshaw had
sat at their adjoining desks in this room and
opened mail, dictated letters, and considered
investments, for so many years? Her welling
sense of gratitude gave her a novel attitude of
sympathetic comprehension. If her secretary,
so long the sole partner and confidant of her
days, were suffering now from being to a degree
usurped, it would not be surprising. She felt a
sort of yearning toward him.</p>

<p>He rose at her entrance, grave and businesslike
as usual. She took her customary place beside
him, and he seated himself, drawing toward
him the morning’s mail.</p>

<p>“Never mind that now, Grim. We will attend
to it this afternoon, if I can keep awake.”
She gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>He glanced around at her. Miss Frink,
flushed and laughing, unmindful of the mail!
From bad to worse!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“The gayety of last evening too much for
you?” he responded, with a gravity so portentous
as to be a rebuke.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Say, Grim, how did Goldstein
get in here?”</p>

<p>“I asked him. I knew your desire not to
have anybody overlooked.”</p>

<p>“But we have never had any contact with
him.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw cleared his throat, and drew forward
a bunch of pencils and put them back
again.</p>

<p>“He is one of our stirring citizens,” he said.</p>

<p>“I know he stirs me,” remarked Miss Frink.</p>

<p>“He enjoyed the evening greatly,” declared
Grimshaw.</p>

<p>“All right; but, if he ever comes to make his
party call, remember he is your guest.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>“Now, my dear boy,” she went on, and she
laid a hand on her secretary’s arm. He regarded
it under dropped lids. “I feel I want to
say a few things to you in this great change that
has come into my life.”</p>

<p>“I have anticipated it,” he returned. “You
wish to dispense with my services?”</p>

<p>Miss Frink withdrew her hand. “What
could put such a wild idea into your head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Grim? So far from dispensing with you, I feel it
an occasion to speak of my appreciation of your
faithful service. In the great joy that has come
to me I long to give happiness. If it pleases you
to know that your efficient work is not taken for
granted, but that it is given its full value, I want
you to realize that I thank you.” She paused
and the secretary bowed silently.</p>

<p>“In the changes that will result from the discovery
of my nephew, I want you to know also
that none will affect you. You are mentioned in
my will, and nothing regarding you in that will
be changed.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw did not alter his position, but some
pulse leaped to his throat. It was not a leap of
gladness. If that were the case, then his employer’s
plans for him had fallen below expectations.</p>

<p>“In short,” said Miss Frink, “since this great
blessing that has come to me should make me a
better woman, I hope to be a better friend to
you and to all.” As her companion did not
break the pause that followed this, she added:
“I hope you don’t begrudge it to me, Grim?”</p>

<p>“By no means, Miss Frink,” he responded,
without looking up. “Pardon me for a moment,
I am much moved.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink was touched. “The good boy!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
she thought. “Probably constant contact with
me has made it impossible for him to express
any feeling that does not regard dollars and
cents.”</p>

<p>“My narrow life could not fail to narrow
you,” she said humbly. “I hope we may both
expand after this.”</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a minute. Grimshaw continued
to look down, one hand toying with a
paper-cutter.</p>

<p>At last she spoke: “I told Adèle you would
take her over to Mrs. Cooper’s as soon as she
was ready.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to,” he returned. “Adèle
made a great impression last night.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, she did. There is no doubt that she
can teach here if she wishes to. I have just been
saying to her that I hope, when the subject
comes up, she will aid in letting it be known
what a passive part Hugh played in the camouflaged
way he came to Farrandale. Mr. Ogden
was the motive power of it all, and you must
help, too, Grim, in giving the right impression.”</p>

<p>The secretary turned to her with a strange
smile. “Do you think that your nephew and
heir will need any apologies?” he asked slowly.
Miss Frink felt uncomfortably the inimical attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
back of the words. “If he does, he will
never know it, and you will never know it.
That is the advantage of being the Queen of
Farrandale.”</p>

<p>“The boy is jealous!” she thought.</p>

<p>“I hope,” he continued, “that your absorption
is not so great that you cannot use your influence
to help Adèle, even though she is leaving
your house.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink felt the criticism in this. She was
silent for a space.</p>

<p>“Adèle came here camouflaged also, Grim,”
she said quietly. “She will tell you about it.”</p>

<p>The secretary flashed a quick look around at
her. “Perfectly innocent in one case, I suppose,”
he said, “and unpardonable in the other.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink was too deeply troubled about
Adèle’s future in Farrandale to be ruffled by
this. “It was her own idea,” she said. “That
makes some difference. I am glad she has a
friend in a truly upright man like you, Grim.
Help her to be a good woman.”</p>

<p>The secretary frowned in surprise at the earnestness
of this appeal; but, before he could
speak, Adèle entered the room dressed for driving,
smiling, and with head held high.</p>

<p>Her departure with Grimshaw a few minutes
later was decorous. Miss Frink was at the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hugh will want to say good-bye to you,”
she said. “Won’t you call him, Grim?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” interrupted Adèle. “He is at his
studies. Don’t disturb him. We shall always be
meeting.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink stood on the veranda and watched
the motor drive away. She drew a long breath
of the sweet air. Whatever should come now,
Adèle was gone from the house. The relief of it!</p>

<p>In the motor, the two, sitting side by side,
exchanged a mutual regard.</p>

<p>“It was very, very sweet of you to write me
that note,” said Grimshaw.</p>

<p>“I thought it would help.”</p>

<p>“There has been some trouble between you
and Miss Frink,” he pursued.</p>

<p>Adèle lifted her eyebrows and gave a little
laugh. “Yes. Mr. Ogden kindly tipped her off
that I was merely the step-grandchild of her beloved
chum.”</p>

<p>“Step-grandchild?” repeated Grimshaw.</p>

<p>“Yes. Complicated, isn’t it?—and not
worth while trying to understand. It served her
as well as anything else as an excuse to get rid of
me.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw frowned. He was angry with his
employer for sending this lovely creature away
from the luxurious home, the Steinway grand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and himself; but Miss Frink’s novel gentleness
in their interview chained his always cautious
tongue; then, if Adèle had really deliberately
misrepresented facts, he knew how that must
have offended Miss Frink’s rigorous principles.</p>

<p>“You will find the change to the simplicity of
the Cooper home rather hard, Adèle.”</p>

<p>“No harder than your discovery that henceforward
you are second-best in your home,”
she returned; but her voice was sympathetic,
even tender. “Perhaps you will have to go
away.”</p>

<p>“No; she doesn’t want me to leave,” he answered
dispiritedly. He turned again suddenly
to his companion: “You must tell me, Adèle,
how I can help you. How about this teaching
business?”</p>

<p>She smiled at him, her sweetest. “Leonard,
can you see me trudging around in all weathers
and teaching youngsters how to play scales?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Hu—somebody said it was like harnessing
a blooded horse to a coal wagon to make me
teach.”</p>

<p>Color rushed to Grimshaw’s face. “Adèle, it
can’t be! You know I—”</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a laugh. “Look out!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
You nearly ran into that Mr. and Mrs. Rube in
their light wagon. Now, I’ll talk to the motor
man if he doesn’t look at me.” Grimshaw kept
eyes ahead, and she continued. “I never had
the dimmest idea of teaching. I knew something
would turn up, and it has. Did you notice Mr.
Goldstein draw me aside for a few minutes last
night?”</p>

<p>“Yes; confound his impudence, keeping
everybody else waiting.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Mr. Goldstein is a highly important
friend. He wants me to take charge of the
music at the Koh-i-noor. He’s mad about the
new organ, and he says I’m just the person they
have been looking for.”</p>

<p>“Can you play the organ?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve played one; and I have three
weeks before they open. He wants to add an
orchestra later, and he wants me to take full
charge of the musical end of the theater.”</p>

<p>“Pretty fine—but Miss Frink—”</p>

<p>“Who is Miss Frink?” asked Adèle saucily.
“Leonard”—she leaned toward him, and her
pressure thrilled him—“you and I have our
own lives to live.”</p>

<p>“That arrangement would make you very
independent, Adèle.”</p>

<p>“I can never be independent of the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
I’m fond of,” she answered softly, and withdrew
from him.</p>

<p>“Strange that Goldstein should be the one to
approach you just now. I have had some business
dealings with him, and he is all right; he
has big, generous ideas. There is nothing small
about Goldstein. He is after me now to put
through a deal for him, but I don’t know. He
makes it very tempting for me, but I’m afraid
Miss Frink—”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be tied to her apron-string. What
is the deal?”</p>

<p>“Well, then, mum’s the word,” said Grimshaw,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, mum as an oyster,” she returned.</p>

<p>“He wants to buy that place where the
Duanes live.”</p>

<p>Adèle’s heart leaped. “What does he want of
that little shanty?”</p>

<p>“He wants to tear it down and put up a flat
building to cover the whole lot.”</p>

<p>“Splendid idea,” responded Adèle. “It’s
high time Farrandale had something handsome
in the way of an apartment building,
and Mr. Goldstein would do something with
class.”</p>

<p>“But Colonel Duane’s garden. He is wrapped
up in the place, and they haven’t any money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for another. It just happened that the cottage
fitted their needs and was cheap.”</p>

<p>Color brightened Adèle’s pale face. Lady
Luck was coming her way. To get rid of Millicent
Duane was a rosier prospect than even the
music at the Koh-i-noor.</p>

<p>“They could find a place in the country,”
she said. “It would be something new if Miss
Frink wanted to throw over such a chance to
turn a few honest thousands. You ought not to
let her. You ought to look after her better than
that.”</p>

<p>“I told Goldstein that there was a probability
that sentiment might enter into this matter;
and he has offered to make it very much worth
my while to put the sale through. It is the biggest
temptation I ever received.” The speaker’s
eyes shone.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you another,” said Adèle, leaning
toward him again. “If you will put through the
sale of the Duane place, I will—forget that
there is another man in the world but you.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw flushed, and the road being clear
just then, he met her soft gaze.</p>

<p>“Is that a promise, Adèle?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A solemn promise,” she answered.</p>

<p class="tb">John Ogden returned to his hostess in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
for luncheon. Leonard Grimshaw had remained
for lunch at his cousin’s, for Adèle wanted him to
go with her afterward to see Mr. Goldstein and
talk over her contract. So it was that the three
who felt very close to one another to-day sat at
the table alone. Stebbins was dismissed, to his
regret, for he had found breakfast very interesting
and he wished to continue gathering data.</p>

<p>Ogden noted that the flush on Miss Frink’s
cheeks, and Hugh’s subdued manner, persisted.</p>

<p>“I had a delightful call this morning,” he
said in his usual cheerful tone. “I dropped my
little bomb on the Duanes’ piazza with great
effect.”</p>

<p>Hugh glanced up at him sharply.</p>

<p>“I do like those people. They have a distinctly
pleasant atmosphere. Colonel Duane,
always looking like somebody in particular, and
so hospitable, and Miss Millicent more like a
rosebud than ever this morning in a pink apron,
delving in a big tin pan.”</p>

<p>“He went to tell them what a happy woman
I am,” explained Miss Frink, looking across at
Hugh. He met her eyes, and smiled acknowledgment,
the more gently for the mutiny
within. At last he was honest, but he was more
than ever conspicuous and discussed. He hated
it. His ears burned now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose they nearly fainted,” he remarked.
“I’m sure you told them that I was a puppet
and you pulled the wires.”</p>

<p>“Don’t put it that way, Hugh,” pleaded Miss
Frink.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, Aunt Susanna! It’s a mess!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say so, dear boy.” Hugh met her
bright, speaking eyes. “I have always been a
successful woman, that’s what the world calls it;
but I never was a happy one until last night.”</p>

<p>“I’m not much to make you happy,” said
the boy restively. “Just a pawn in a game, not
a penny in the world of my own, in debt to Ogden,
and a sneak in the eyes of your town—”</p>

<p>“Oh, my boy! Oh, Hugh!” There was such
pain and longing in Miss Frink’s tone that it
checked him. Beside all that he expressed was
the constant irritation and humiliation that remained
from the scene with Adèle.</p>

<p>“Hugh, you told me last night that you—”
Miss Frink stopped because something rose in
her throat. No one broke the silence. “I know
how your young pride is hurt,” she went on at
last, “but it will be restored.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Duane said,” put in Ogden, “that
there would be very little talk: that wherever
you went, Miss Frink’s nephew would be always
welcome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is true,” she agreed; “and, Hugh, if
you can be so unselfish, don’t spoil this great
joy of mine—a child belonging to me; but take
it as if we had known all along that you were
mine. In perfect frankness let me do for you
what it is my right to do. In the presence of Mr.
Ogden, who has accomplished such wonders for
us, let me say that he and I shall together settle
such of our obligation to him as can be paid, and
then you, Hugh, until you are admitted to the
bar, will accept from me your education, and
your allowance, without a thought of dependence—”</p>

<p>Hugh regarded the earnest speaker with a
mixture of resistance and appreciation.</p>

<p>“Ross Graham Company—” he began—</p>

<p>“Can take care of itself,” said Miss Frink
with a return of her brisk, curt manner. “You
can always get competent managers.” John
Ogden’s mind took a leap back to the day when
he told Hugh that the department store might
belong to him. “Now I know,” went on Miss
Frink, “that you’re a bit afraid of your old
aunt, a little afraid that in my pride I may want
to put you into a velvet suit and lace collar à la
Fauntleroy, or its equivalent; but you needn’t
be afraid. I haven’t lived seventy-two years for
nothing, and I didn’t make a mess of my treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of your father for nothing. Neither am I
in my second childhood. I have all my faculties,
and, with so much now to live for, I expect to
keep them until I’m one hundred. I don’t want
to make an idol of you. I want you to be a man
among men, and stand on your own feet; but
it’s my right to give you a start, and I like to
believe that you have enough common sense to
accept it in the spirit in which it is offered, without
any fuss or foolish hair-splitting.”</p>

<p>Hugh looked around at Ogden, who nodded
at him.</p>

<p>“Put that in your pipe and smoke it,” remarked
Ogden.</p>

<p>Hugh, pushing back his chair, rose and came
around to Miss Frink.</p>

<p>“There’s only one answer a fellow can make
to all that, Aunt Susanna,” he said, and, stooping,
he kissed her.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” she, too, rose, “please go on
the veranda and watch for Millicent. I want to
see Mr. Ogden a few minutes in the study, and
I’ll let her know when I’m ready for her.”</p>

<p>Hugh wandered through the hall, pausing between
the portières of the drawing-room and
looking at the piano. Was it only last evening
that Ally had done her brilliant work? He
shook his head, went out to the piazza, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
started to take the swinging seat, but changed
his mind, and, throwing himself on a wicker
divan, lighted a cigarette. He was conscious of
a deep soreness in the thought of Adèle. What a
series of foolish moves her life had been! He
shrank in distaste from it all.</p>

<p>What a different specimen of girlhood was
Millicent Duane! Of course, she was nothing
but a child, with her ready tears and blushes;
still, it was better to be crude, and sweet, and
pure, than sophisticated and audacious. He
wished he could have seen her face when Ogden
told them his news. A certain looking up to
himself which the girl had evinced in their daily
meetings, he suddenly found was valuable to
him. Colonel Duane had said Miss Frink’s
nephew was always sure of a welcome. He knew
what that meant, and the implication again
stirred his rebellion. He would know when he
saw Millicent to-day if he had much to live
down in her transparent soul.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">MILLICENT</span></h2>

<p>Very soon Millicent’s familiar figure appeared
at the iron gate. Before she started from home
she had talked with her grandfather.</p>

<p>“You’re sending a message to Hugh by me
that it will be more convenient for you to see
him in the morning after this,” she said.</p>

<p>“But it wouldn’t.” Colonel Duane looked
surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will be,” returned Millicent firmly.</p>

<p>The old gentleman blinked. “What’s this?
Tired of the walks over here together?”</p>

<p>“Never mind details, dear.”</p>

<p>“You’re a funny child, Milly. Hugh will feel
something unfriendly in the change, just at the
present time.”</p>

<p>Millicent seized her grandfather’s arm.
“Dearest, everything wonderful is going to
come to Hugh, now,” she said earnestly, “and I
would like to be out of it. I don’t want to hear
him talk about it. Hugh Sinclair isn’t Hugh
Stanwood. He won’t be anything to us; not
even a friend except at long intervals and—can’t
you understand? I’d rather be the one to
do the dropping.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>She released him suddenly and ran out of the
house. Her grandfather stood in the same spot
for some minutes, considering.</p>

<p>“It’s the most natural thing in the world,” he
said to himself at last. “I don’t see how she
could help it; but Milly has plenty of spirit, and
I’ll take the hint till he goes away. Of course,
he’ll be going away to law school.”</p>

<p>Now, as Millicent entered Miss Frink’s
grounds and discerned Hugh on the porch, she
saw him rise and throw away his cigarette. He
came down the steps to meet her, looking unusually
grave. His eyes studied her as if he must
know her attitude before she spoke. She put her
hand in the one he offered.</p>

<p>“How now that the cat is out of the bag?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“What difference can it make to me?” she
returned with a coolness that did not satisfy
him.</p>

<p>“I’m glad if it doesn’t make any. I thought
perhaps there wouldn’t be any route sufficiently
roundabout for you to take me home this afternoon.”</p>

<p>His gaze continued to study her as they ascended
the steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was to tell you that Grandpa can’t
have you to-day. He will be glad to see you to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
morning if you can come—and always
in the morning hereafter.”</p>

<p>Hugh nodded. Millicent started to go into
the house.</p>

<p>“Sit down a few minutes,” he said. “Aunt
Susanna and Mr. Ogden are busy in the study.
He is leaving to-night. She said she would call
you as soon as she was ready.”</p>

<p>Millicent seated herself in the swinging couch
and Hugh promptly took the place beside her.</p>

<p>“So our walks are over, are they?” he asked,
still grave.</p>

<p>“Yes. Life is just like chapters in a story,
isn’t it?” she replied hurriedly. “One closes and
another begins. This swing makes me think of
Mrs. Lumbard. Grandpa is perfectly wild about
her ever since last night. Mr. Ogden said she
was going to live at the Coopers’, and on my
way over here I met a friend who said he had
heard that the manager of the Koh-i-noor is going
to try to get her to provide their music.”</p>

<p>Hugh nodded. “That would solve a problem
for her,” he said.</p>

<p>There was nothing natural about Millicent
to-day, and he had seen her shrink when he took
the place beside her in the swing.</p>

<p>She went on: “Something big like that would
seem more fitted to Mrs. Lumbard than teaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
I wonder if she will take the position.
You’ll miss her here, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, another of those chapters that close
while another begins. If only the story grows
more interesting as life goes on.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it will for you.” That was too personal.
She hurried headlong. “And I think it
does for all of us. You talked to that cute girl
Damaris Cooper last night. She will be delirious
with Mrs. Lumbard living there, and playing
at the Koh-i-noor. Who said Farrandale was
dull!” Millicent laughed.</p>

<p>Hugh had not smiled since she came, and she
was so uncomfortable under his questioning
eyes that she welcomed the opening of the door
and the appearance of John Ogden who took
in the deceptively intimate appearance of the
swing.</p>

<p>“Your sleepy lady awaits you, Miss Duane,”
he announced, “and you certainly will do a
missionary act to make her rest. She needs it.”
Millicent sprang up. “So I’ll say good-bye once
more.” He held out his hand, and the girl gave
him hers.</p>

<p>“Farrandale will be very glad to see you back
some day, Mr. Ogden.” She vanished into the
house.</p>

<p>“It’s just as I expected,” said Hugh gloomily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
“Millicent is entirely changed, and Colonel
Duane can see me only in the mornings after
this. It’s significant of the whole spirit that I
shall have to meet.”</p>

<p>John Ogden viewed the downcast gaze.</p>

<p>“You crazy—” he began—“I’ll say I hate
to leave you. You’ll be deserting Miss Frink
between two days, as likely as not.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” returned Hugh decidedly.
“I’ve made up my mind to stay with her.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to hear that.”</p>

<p>“But it makes me—if Millicent had cried or
done anything natural, I could stand it; or if
she would say right out that she is disgusted, I
could stand it; but to have her feel that it is too
bad to talk about; that gets me because what
she feels is what everybody worth caring about
will feel.”</p>

<p>John Ogden regarded the boy as he sat there
in the swing, dejected, and his own lips twitched.</p>

<p>Hugh looked up suddenly. “Don’t you think
she’s a fine girl, Ogden?”</p>

<p>“I do. Pure as a drop of dew; fine as a rose-leaf,
softly iridescent as a bird’s wing, transparent
as crystal—”</p>

<p>Hugh frowned in displeased surprise.</p>

<p>“I wish you could do anything but chaff,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not chaffing,” replied Ogden; “but I
must modify that a little, I should have said,
<em>sometimes</em> as transparent as crystal.”</p>

<p>“Are you in love with her?” blurted out
Hugh.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should be if I hadn’t known
Carol. The man that she loves will be in luck,
for though tender as a flower she’s as stanch as
an oak tree.”</p>

<p>“You should write poetry,” said Hugh dryly.
“After all that, you can’t blame me for preferring
that that sort of person should approve of
me.”</p>

<p>Ogden, sitting in a hammock and swinging his
foot, regarded the other quizzically for a silent
moment.</p>

<p>“Your lions in the way are going to turn into
kittens, boy,” he said at last. “And if they
didn’t, isn’t it worth something to have transformed
the life of another human as you have
Miss Frink’s? Isn’t it worth meeting with some
annoyance?”</p>

<p>Hugh shrugged his shoulders in silence.</p>

<p>When Millicent entered her employer’s room,
the lady was not lying down as usual. She met
the girl with a sort of smiling exaltation.</p>

<p>“Do I look any different to-day?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You do look different. You have such pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
cheeks. I suppose you are still excited from last
night.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so.” As she spoke, Miss Frink
drew the girl down beside her on the divan and
looked blissfully into her face. “What a comment
it is on me, Millicent, that you are the
only woman friend I have to pour out to at a
time like this—and you not a woman yet, just
a little girl who can’t appreciate happiness, because
you’ve never had anything else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have, Miss Frink, I’ve been terribly
unhappy—is it because you’re happy that you
look so rosy?” Millicent’s heart beat under the
full, bright gaze bent upon her.</p>

<p>“Yes, all at once. The last time you saw me
I was nobody. I was grubbing along the way
I have all my life, nobody caring about me
except to get the better of me in a business
deal, and now to-day—do you wonder my
cheeks are pink? I’m a grandmother, Millicent.”</p>

<p>“You are!” The girl’s lips were parted.</p>

<p>“You know it’s even nicer than being a
mother. Everybody knows that grandmothers
have the best of it. Mr. Ogden has told you
that Hugh belongs to me, and at midnight last
night we, Hugh and I, were alone together, and—and
we talked of it. He seemed to be glad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
He kissed me like a real grandchild. Millicent,
it seemed too wonderful for words that I should
be really happy! Those young arms around me
made me feel richer than—doubling my money
on a corner lot.”</p>

<p>Millicent began to swallow fast.</p>

<p>“I’m so—so gl-glad,” she said. “I’ll try—not
to cry.”</p>

<p>“You’re very sweet to care, child. You and
Hugh are so well acquainted I feel you will always
take an interest.”</p>

<p>“It was wonderful!” said Millicent. The
eagerness in the bright eyes impelled her on.
“Hugh is—my grandfather thinks he is an unusual
fellow. He has always seemed so frank,
and kind, and simple. He takes an interest in
Grandpa’s garden and is so nice about it. He
often says he wishes he owned a little place just
like ours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he does, does he?” returned Miss Frink
dryly. “Well, you’re ahead of me. I have never
heard him express a wish for anything.”</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Frink, you must lie down,” said
the girl. “Mr. Ogden told me to be sure to make
you rest.” She arranged the pillows just as her
employer liked them, persuaded her to change
her dress for a negligée, and soon the happy
woman was settled on the couch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll guarantee I won’t wake up and find it
all a dream?”</p>

<p>“I promise it,” she said.</p>

<p>Hugh was still on the piazza and alone when
she went out. He rose at sight of her. She had
never seen him look so serious. He did not advance,
just looked at her in silence. She went to
him, her hands outstretched.</p>

<p>“I’ve been talking with her,” she said. Her
own repressed feelings, the remembrance of
Miss Frink’s exaltation, and the wonder of
Hugh, himself, overcame her. She could not
speak; but her smile and her suddenly flooded
eyes made his gravity break into sunshine.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, then, is it, Millicent?” he
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>She tried to pull a hand away to get her handkerchief,
but he held it fast and, seeing the corner
of linen protruding from the low neck of her
dress, he took it out and dried her eyes himself.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to cry—much,” she said,
smiling, “but she is so happy.”</p>

<p>“I’m a lucky dog, Millicent—if you think I
am,” he answered. “It hasn’t been easy.” His
eyes clouded.</p>

<p>“I know it, Hugh. I can see it all, now.”</p>

<p>“And I mustn’t walk home with you?”</p>

<p>She hesitated. “I suppose you shouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
leave Mr. Ogden alone. He goes so soon and
Miss Frink is asleep.”</p>

<p>Hugh smiled down at her. She wished he
wouldn’t. She could hardly bear it. “A good
excuse for you not to have to try to hide me,”
he returned.</p>

<p>“No; I shall never wish to hide you again,”
she said.</p>

<p>“You think I’m all right, then, eh, Millicent?”</p>

<p>“I know you are,” she answered, and, releasing
herself and giving him an April smile, she
ran down the steps.</p>

<p class="tb">It was no small undertaking for Miss Frink,
in the days that followed, to keep her word
about not idolizing her grand-nephew. What
she did for him she tried to clothe in such a matter-of-fact
manner as to disarm him. Almost at
once invitations began to come to Hugh from
the young people of Farrandale for tennis parties,
dances, picnics, and so on. Miss Frink saw
that he was declining them all. She went to his
room one morning with another envelope in her
hand.</p>

<p>“This has just come from the Tarrants,” she
said, “and I suppose it is another invitation. I
hope you will accept, Hugh, for they are among
our best people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know much about society, Aunt Susanna.
I’d rather keep off the grass if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do mind,” she answered pleasantly.
“People will misunderstand if you refuse to mix.
They will think that either you don’t know how,
or else that you feel superior.”</p>

<p>“Both of them correct,” replied Hugh, laughing.</p>

<p>“Neither of them correct,” returned Miss
Frink. “The first thing for you to do is to get
suitable clothes for the different sorts of things.
Sports clothes, evening duds, and so on.”</p>

<p>“Remember, Aunt Susanna. It was agreed.
No Lord Fauntleroy.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” she returned briskly. “Don’t get
a velvet suit. I forbid it; but please order the
other things at once. Then, if you want to decline
an invitation, it won’t be because you
haven’t the proper things to wear.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were so vain.”</p>

<p>“I am, very. Now here is your bank book.”
She laid the little leather book on the table.
“And here is your check book.” Hugh stepped
toward her. “Now, not a word,” she warned.
“You know that was agreed upon. The first of
every month I shall deposit your allowance to
your account.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh had reached her now. He put his arm
around her and kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>“And this afternoon I want you to go on an
errand with me. I’ve waked up lately to what a
hidebound person I’ve always been: unwilling
to move with the world. I’ve decided that I
want an automobile.”</p>

<p>Hugh raised his eyebrows. “Well, I can’t
see Rex and Regina thrown into the discard.”</p>

<p>“No, neither can I; but there are times when
the convenience of a motor cannot be gainsaid.
I borrow Leonard’s occasionally, and it is absurd,
when you come to think of it, to let a foolish
prejudice deprive one of a convenience. A
motor is a great convenience.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be denied,” said Hugh, restraining
himself from claiming to smell a large and obvious
mouse. She was having such a good time.</p>

<p>He hugged her once more, and she left the
room as one whom business is driving. He looked
at the record in his bank book and gave a low
whistle.</p>

<p>When the rumor of Adèle’s new position
reached Miss Frink, she did not have to assume
approval in speaking to her secretary about it.
The fact that the young woman was going to
play to the young people of Farrandale from
a distance, instead of standing toward them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the intimate relation of a teacher, was a distinct
relief. She still felt that new kindness toward
Grimshaw which came from the belief that he
felt usurped, and, perceiving in him a champion
of Adèle, she took pains to express herself pleasantly,
as they sat together at their desks.</p>

<p>“I suppose the Koh-i-noor engagement will
be a good arrangement for Adèle,” she said. “It
comes as a surprise.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t think she is fitted for the drudgery
of teaching,” he returned.</p>

<p>“No one is who considers it drudgery,” declared
Miss Frink. “When is the theater to
open?”</p>

<p>“A week from to-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, they have secured a real musician.”</p>

<p>“Adèle will be glad to hear that she has your
approval,” said Grimshaw. He took from his
pocket an envelope. “Mr. Goldstein asked me
to give you these tickets for the opening. He
hopes you will honor him with your presence.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink took the offered envelope. Across
it was written: “For the Queen of Farrandale.”</p>

<p>“You know I don’t go to the movies, Grim.
Why didn’t you tell him so?”</p>

<p>“Because this is different. He intends to
give only artistic entertainment. Everybody
will go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I don’t expect to be in town a week
from to-night.”</p>

<p>“Ah? I didn’t know you were planning to
leave. Is Mr. Sinclair accompanying you?”</p>

<p>The secretary always clung to the formal title.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t. You and he can divide these
tickets and take your best girls. Perhaps he will
have one by that time.”</p>

<p>She put the envelope back on Grimshaw’s
desk.</p>

<span class="smaller">A SHOCK</span></h2>

<p>Miss Frink had instinctively felt that during
the first weeks of his new status in the town
Hugh would not wish to be seen driving with
her in her well-known equipage, and she had
desisted from asking him; but to-day he was beside
her as the handsome bays jingled toward
that large salesroom where reposed their hitherto
unsuccessful rivals.</p>

<p>“Now I have picked out a car,” said Miss
Frink as they neared their goal, “but I didn’t
want to buy it without your approval because,
of course, I hope you would like to drive me a
good deal.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” replied Hugh. “I certainly
should like to.”</p>

<p>As they entered the salesroom, a man came
forward to welcome them eagerly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Godfrey, this is my nephew, Mr. Sinclair,
and I want him to see that roadster I was
looking at.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Frink, I’ve been watching for
you.”</p>

<p>He led the way to where a low, rakish, canary-colored
machine shone gayly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh stared at it.</p>

<p>“Is this the one, Aunt Susanna?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, rather defiantly. “You
know I don’t do things by halves. If I’m going
to have a motor, I want to go the whole figure.
I told Mr. Godfrey I wanted a snappy, classy
car: even if it was extreme: even if it was to cars
what jazz is to music.”</p>

<p>Hugh looked at the salesman, but no sense of
humor could be discerned in his earnest countenance.
Hugh struggled with his own risibles
and also with a desire to hug his aunt in public.
It seemed the only way to deal with her.</p>

<p>“How were you going to get into it, Aunt
Susanna?” he asked.</p>

<p>She gazed at the machine, observing for the
first time that it had no doors.</p>

<p>“I—why—” she began.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t want to turn a somersault
every time you went for an outing, would you?”</p>

<p>She looked at him helplessly. “Don’t you
like it, Hugh?” she asked faintly.</p>

<p>He looked again at the salesman to see if
he was human. Apparently the depth of Miss
Frink’s pocketbook was the only feature of the
transaction which he was taking in.</p>

<p>“Let’s find something a little less sporty,” he
continued. “You’ve a fine assortment here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right, Hugh, you choose,” said Miss
Frink, her spirits rising, “and don’t think too
much about me. One that you would like to
drive is what I want.”</p>

<p>They chose one at last. It was very dark
blue, and very shiny, and low hung, and very
expensive, and it had embryo doors, and could
be delivered promptly, and Hugh’s eyes shone
at the prospect of being its chauffeur. Miss
Frink was tremulous with happiness at seeing
his pleasure, and they returned home to dinner,
her hand in his.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do with you, Aunt
Susanna,” he said.</p>

<p>“Now, Hugh, you’re doing me injustice,” she
returned firmly. “I do want to drive in an auto.
I want to progress, and not be a clam. Besides,
I’m going away, and I thought you could learn
all about the machine while I am gone.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To Waveland Beach. It is only a few hours
from here. I guess I’m tired. At any rate, I’m
not sleeping very well, and I’ll get down there
and not hear a word about business for a few
weeks.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you’re not feeling all right. Can’t
I do something? Don’t you want me to go with
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, she did, but she denied it. “No,
you stay here and go on with Colonel Duane.
Shan’t you choose Columbia in the fall? I’ve
been writing to Carol and telling her we are
going to have a full-fledged lawyer of our own
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>So a few days later Miss Frink departed to
her resort, and it fitted in so well with Leonard
Grimshaw’s plans that she should go away, that
he was quite affable about the new automobile,
and in his first tête-à-tête dinner with Hugh was
less taciturn than usual.</p>

<p>He talked of the cleverness with which Adèle
handled the Koh-i-noor organ. He gave him
the tickets for the opening of the Cinema Palace,
and Hugh took Millicent and her grandfather
and Damaris Cooper, and they had a delightful
party. They talked with Adèle afterward. She
was in the highest spirits, and Leonard Grimshaw
stood beside her with an air of proprietorship
which Hugh discerned with satisfaction.</p>

<p>The secretary had not yet qualified for that
reward of hers, promised when he should have
evicted the Duanes; and seeing Millicent with
Hugh to-night created in Adèle a tigerish eagerness
for its fulfillment.</p>

<p>“Have patience,” Leonard told her when
the others had gone. “Everything is working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
toward the desired end; but why are you so
interested?” he added.</p>

<p>“Can you ask?” she returned with one of the
looks he dreamed about. “Is it nothing to—to
us that Goldstein wishes to be so generous?”</p>

<p>Grimshaw smiled. “We may be living in
that apartment house ourselves, Adèle. Who
knows?”</p>

<p>One afternoon there appeared in Colonel
Duane’s garden an alien growth in the shape
of the manager of the Koh-i-noor. The owner
saw him walking along the garden paths and in
surprise went out to meet him.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldstein held out his hand. “It looks
like intrusion, I’m sure, Colonel Duane, but
you excuse me if I look this ground over; I have
a strong personal interest.”</p>

<p>Colonel Duane mechanically shook hands.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am about to buy this property.” The
visitor smiled into the old gentleman’s startled
face.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard nothing of this,” said the Colonel,
and his voice was not steady. “Miss Frink is
away.”</p>

<p>“Ah, who so progressive as Miss Frink!”
said Goldstein devoutly. “This property is too
valuable for its present use. I will put an apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
building here that you will be proud to live
in—proud, Colonel Duane.”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t realize that what you say is
true.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is nothing to worry you,” said
Goldstein soothingly. “You will not be required
to leave before the autumn. I’m sure we would
not do anything to disturb or annoy so respected
a citizen.” The speaker’s eyes wandered afield.
“I wanted to see what the chances would be of
retaining that old elm in the corner there. You
know, Colonel Duane, to me a fine tree is an asset.
There is something money cannot buy. It
is worth a sacrifice to retain it. It is a thing that
the years only can produce. It is—” He turned
to face his companion, but the old gentleman
had gone.</p>

<p>Colonel Duane entered the room where his
granddaughter was, and Millicent started up in
alarm.</p>

<p>“What is it Grandpa? Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had a shock, Milly. Miss Frink is going
to sell our place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t believe it! Not without any
warning.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Goldstein, of the Koh-i-noor, is going
to buy it. He is out there now, looking the
ground over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent ran to the window. She could see
the purchaser, his hands folded behind him
looking up at the fine old tree. She turned back
to her grandfather with eyes that flashed. Her
soft lips set in a hard line.</p>

<p>“How can she do it with all her money! How
can she take your garden away, Grandpa?”</p>

<p>“He is going to put up a flat building.” Colonel
Duane sank into a chair. “We can’t expect
the world to stand still for us, Milly. Business
is business. Mr. Goldstein says this land is too
valuable to be left for an old man to go puttering
about in.” He smiled pitifully.</p>

<p>“That is why she has gone away,” said Millicent
acutely. “She was ashamed to do this to
you, Grandpa.”</p>

<p>“Being ashamed is not in Miss Frink’s line,”
he answered, and his pale, still face gave the
girl the heartache. “It is the habit of her life
to take advantage of business opportunities.
Here came along a man with the money, and
the plan. I suppose it was the natural move for
her to make.”</p>

<p>“But she knows you, Grandpa. She knows
what it will mean to you. I tell you she went
away because she was ashamed to own it.
There he goes, the mean thing.” Millicent
watched the future owner’s departure up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
street, and at once from the other direction appeared
Hugh Sinclair driving the very new, very
blue, very shiny roadster.</p>

<p>“Oh, there is Hugh!” she exclaimed, her
hands clasping together. “He has come to
take me driving, Grandpa. Your news put it
out of my head.”</p>

<p>The horn of the motor sounded, and the
girl waved her hand toward Hugh’s blowing
hair.</p>

<p>“Now be very careful, Milly,” said Colonel
Duane. “You’re excited, and you’re liable to say
the wrong thing to Hugh. This property is Miss
Frink’s, and she has a right to do just what she
pleases with it. Don’t make Hugh unhappy
over a matter he can’t do anything about.”</p>

<p>The girl caught the speaker in her strong
young arms and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Promise me, Milly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, yes,” she said breathlessly, and
ran out to the waiting motor.</p>

<p>“My word, you’re all lit up, Millicent,”
laughed Hugh at sight of her sparkling eyes.
“You must like this little gas buggy as much as
I do.”</p>

<p>They were off before she answered. “Yes, I
love it; but I wanted, I needed, so much to see
you, Hugh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>“I like that all right. What do you want of
little Johnny-on-the-spot?”</p>

<p>“Just to talk to you. Of course I know you
can’t do anything, and Grandpa told me to be
very careful and not make you unhappy—”</p>

<p>“It can’t be done, Millicent. An afternoon
like this, and the car, and you. What’s going to
make me unhappy?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it won’t, but—we’re going to lose
our home, and Grandpa’s garden.”</p>

<p>Hugh met her bright, dry eyes. Tears
wouldn’t do this subject justice.</p>

<p>“How are you going to lose it?”</p>

<p>“Miss Frink is selling it to Mr. Goldstein. He
has just been in the garden looking it over. He
told Grandpa, and when Grandpa came in to
me he looked old. I never saw Grandpa look old
before.”</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake.”</p>

<p>“No. Mr. Goldstein is going to put up a flat
building.”</p>

<p>Hugh’s brow was puckered in a puzzled
frown. “Aunt Susanna would have spoken of it
to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, think what a wonderful business woman
she is. She wouldn’t talk of her business deals to
any one, would she?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” returned Hugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“But Miss Frink likes Grandpa. I believe
she would be sorry for us, and I think, Hugh, it
really makes me more sure that she is selling us
out, that she has gone away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, Millicent. Aunt Susanna isn’t
any coward.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed the girl ruefully, “the Queen of
Farrandale doesn’t have to be; but she seemed
to like us, and I feel she would be sorry and perhaps
would rather be away.”</p>

<p>“My opinion is that Goldstein was talking
through his hat. He probably wants the place—but
so do I.” Hugh turned with the Prince
Charming smile to his companion. “Not for
his purpose, though. I want it always to stay
full of apple blossoms and nice girls in blue
gowns.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hugh, it’s like a bad dream.”</p>

<p>“Let us pretend it is a nightmare until I see
Grimshaw at dinner. He will know the inside
facts, and I will run over this evening and tell
you all about it.”</p>

<p>There had been a humorous side, to Hugh, to
the tête-à-tête meals he and the secretary had
been obliged to take in Miss Frink’s absence.
They seldom met at breakfast or luncheon, but
at the formally correct dinners Hugh comported
himself with care not to be irritating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>To-night he approached the subject on his
mind with circumspection.</p>

<p>“I heard to-day that Mr. Goldstein wants to
purchase the Duane place,” he said.</p>

<p>Grimshaw nodded. “Yes; it will be a very
advantageous move for Miss Frink. The ground
is too central to be used any longer in the present
fashion.”</p>

<p>“You have charge of the transaction?” ventured
Hugh.</p>

<p>Grimshaw did not lift his eyes from his plate.
“Naturally. I have charge of all Miss Frink’s
business moves. I am always watching her interests.”</p>

<p>“That sale would work something of a hardship,”
remarked Hugh.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Grimshaw, with a nonchalant
rising inflection; “but there would be nothing
sudden or violent about it. There are plenty of
places farther out where the Duanes can go, and
it is my duty to think only of Miss Frink.”</p>

<p>“You have her full authority?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I have her full authority.”</p>

<p>“It is a little strange,” said Hugh, “that she
never mentioned the proposition of this sale to
me.”</p>

<p>“You think it strange?” returned Grimshaw,
and there was a scarcely veiled sneer in the retort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
“I believe Miss Frink has not considered
you on the business side as yet.”</p>

<p>Hugh said no more; but less than an hour
later he ran up on the Duanes’ piazza. The evening
was warm, and they were sitting out.</p>

<p>Millicent jumped up eagerly at sight of him
and he grasped her outstretched hand and
held it.</p>

<p>“I am not satisfied, Colonel Duane, with my
talk with Grimshaw,” he said.</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked up, patiently.</p>

<p>“Shall you wire Miss Frink?” asked Millicent
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Colonel Duane. “Hugh
shouldn’t interfere.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall, to the extent of finding out
what’s what.”</p>

<p>Millicent released her hand and sat down.</p>

<p>“The thing to do is for Millicent and me to
motor down to Waveland to-morrow. I learn
that we can do it in four hours. We’ll talk with
Aunt Susanna, and, if we find that she is content
to let Grimshaw do his darndest, we’ll
motor back again; but if it turns out that she is
from Missouri, we three will come back on the
train.”</p>

<p>“That’s fair enough, Grandpa?” asked Millicent
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know that it is. Miss Frink has gone
away to rest and probably left instructions with
her secretary, and for you to go, Milly, and
throw yourself on her sympathy—”</p>

<p>“She shan’t throw herself on anything, Colonel
Duane. I promise it; but it will be so much
more satisfactory for Millicent to see Aunt
Susanna face to face, and hear just what she
says—”</p>

<p>Colonel Duane was thoughtful. “If Miss
Frink does not return with you, I don’t like
the idea of your motoring back here late in the
evening. It would be midnight, probably.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see to that,” returned Hugh. “If Aunt
Susanna doesn’t return with us, she has two
rooms down there, and Millicent will spend the
night with her; and I’ll wire you. We’ll motor
back the next morning.”</p>

<p>“You wish to do it, Milly?” asked Colonel
Duane.</p>

<p>“It seems as if I should fly out of my skin if
I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“If we come back on the train with Aunt
Susanna, it will be late, and Millicent will spend
the night at our house.”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed the old man. “Bring her
home, whatever hour it is.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="smaller">JOURNEY’S END</span></h2>

<p>Miss Frink was sitting on the porch of the Sea
View Hotel, rocking as all good Americans do,
and thinking, as usual, of Hugh.</p>

<p>The expanse of ocean lay before her, and, as
she watched the sailboats careening, she wondered
if her nephew cared for sailing and if he
was a good swimmer. She thought of the desirable
girls in Farrandale. Some of them had had
European educations. She hoped Hugh would
accept the Tarrant invitation. As Miss Frink
passed in review the young people she had seen
grow up without noticing them, Inez Tarrant
stood out in her mind as the most attractive.
She shook her head as a memory of Hugh’s
father struck athwart her thought.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” she reflected. “I won’t interfere
this time, whatever the boy does. He shall
never think of his old aunt as a wet blanket.
Never!”</p>

<p>She was in a blissful dream when suddenly
a car drew up before the hotel porch directly
in front of her rocking-chair. She didn’t recognize
it at first. All its shiny blueness was
dust-laden. So were its occupants. One of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
saw her instantly, and waved his cap. Millicent
was out as quickly as Hugh, pulling off her veil
and looking up with a beating heart at Miss
Frink, who started to her feet.</p>

<p>“We’ve come to lunch with you, Aunt Susanna.”
Hugh embraced her, and she took Millicent’s
timid hand.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t fine of you children! What
sights you are! Take the car to the garage,
Hugh, while I help Millicent to brush up. You
must have started very early,” she added to the
girl when they had reached her room.</p>

<p>“We did, and it has been such a beautiful
morning. The car runs like velvet.”</p>

<p>“You look tired, child. Are those shadows
under your eyes, or is it all dust? Now I’ll leave
you here. Make yourself at home. Don’t hurry.
There’s plenty of time. Come down to the porch
when you’re ready.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink returned to her rocking-chair, and
soon Hugh joined her, washed and brushed to
her heart’s desire.</p>

<p>“I’m your letter to-day, Aunt Susanna,” he
said, pulling up a chair beside her.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take you”—she regarded the
vital light in his eyes—“and read you, too.”</p>

<p>“The X-ray still working?” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Here is a very happy boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“With everything to make him happy,” he
returned.</p>

<p>“The car pleases you?”</p>

<p>“Perfect. The company, too.”</p>

<p>“Me or Millicent?” Miss Frink’s lips
twitched. “My! That girl’s hair was pretty
when it tumbled down just now, upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Both of you,” replied Hugh.</p>

<p>“Have you accepted Miss Tarrant’s invitation?”</p>

<p>“No—yes—Oh, yes, I remember now, I
did, to please you.”</p>

<p>“It will be to please yourself, later.”</p>

<p>Hugh gave her a brilliant smile in which eyes
and lips coöperated with great effect.</p>

<p>“It won’t matter much, Aunt Susanna. There
is only one perfect girl in Farrandale, and I’ve
found her.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink grasped the arms of her chair.</p>

<p>“Hugh Sinclair!” she gasped. “Why, I
never even thought of Millicent Duane!”</p>

<p>He leaned toward her and spoke low. The
smile vanished under his aunt’s aghast eyeglasses.</p>

<p>“Set your X-ray going, Aunt Susanna. See
the modesty, the honesty, the purity, the frankness,
the unselfishness, the charm of total goodness—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you come down here to tell me this?”</p>

<p>“No. I never said a word to her until this
morning on the way; and she refused me. She’s
afraid of you. She believes herself too humble
and obscure to suit you, and she says she’d
rather die than marry me if it didn’t please you.
She loves you, too, Aunt Susanna. She appreciates
you.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s firm resolution of an hour ago
recurred to her. Her surprise was so absolute
that she leaned back in her chair, speechless.</p>

<p>“We just made up our minds suddenly last
night to come, and it has been a most lovely
drive.”</p>

<p>“H’m. Millicent looks as if she had been
through the war.”</p>

<p>“She has. We’ll tell you about it, later.”</p>

<p>Millicent appeared from the doorway, and
Miss Frink noted the expression in Hugh’s face
as he started up to meet her.</p>

<p>“I know you are both famished,” she said.
“Let us go right in to lunch.”</p>

<p>Poor Millicent, with her double burden of apprehension
and embarrassment, made a valiant
attempt to eat, and Hugh saved her from the
necessity of talking by keeping up a busy conversation
with his aunt. As for Miss Frink, she
was constantly fighting a sense of resentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just like me,” she thought. “Just because I
didn’t plan it, I suppose I can’t approve it.
Just because I can’t have him all to myself, I
suppose I wouldn’t like it, whoever it was. Just
like you, Susanna Frink. Just like you!”</p>

<p>When they rose from the table, Hugh spoke.</p>

<p>“We did come down here on an errand, Aunt
Susanna. Is there some place where we can be
entirely by ourselves?”</p>

<p>“We will go up to my room,” she returned.
What could their errand be if it was not on that
rending subject?</p>

<p>“She didn’t eat anything,” reflected Miss
Frink as they went up in the elevator. “I suppose
they don’t when they’re in love.”</p>

<p>Her heart pleaded a little for Millicent, just
then. Even if it were presumptuous for the girl
to fall in love with Hugh, was it within youthful
feminine human nature to help it when they had
been thrown together daily for so long? What
had been nearly superhuman was to refuse him,
shut in with him in that very new, very blue,
shiny roadster with all the early summer surroundings
of romance. The girl had some
strength, anyway. And how sweetly she had
sympathized with herself at the exciting time
of the discovery!</p>

<p>She sat down now, however, with an entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
non-committal expression, and Millicent took
a place facing her. Apparently she was the one
with the message. Hugh wandered to a window
overlooking the sea.</p>

<p>How pale the girl was! The shadows under
her hazel eyes had not been dust. Those eyes
had apparently started out to be brown, but
thought better of it. They were surpassingly
clear, and they looked now directly into Miss
Frink’s.</p>

<p>“I don’t know even yet if it was right for
me to come,” she began. “Grandpa thought it
wasn’t, for we haven’t the least right to trouble
you in your affairs; but it means so much to
Grandpa I couldn’t content myself without
knowing from your own lips if you are selling
our home.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s face continued set. A little
frown came in her forehead.</p>

<p>“Not that we wouldn’t get used to the
thought, but—just at first, it—he made
Grandpa look so old—”</p>

<p>“Who did?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Goldstein. He wants to put up an
apartment house and he was looking the ground
over to see if he could save the elm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Mr. Goldstein. He is Adèle’s—Mrs.
Lumbard’s employer, I believe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Frink”—the hazel eyes searched
the bright eyeglasses—“did Mrs. Lumbard
ask you to sell the place?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Why do you ask such a question?”</p>

<p>“Because—I’m ashamed to say so, but I’ve
thought so much about it. Mrs. Lumbard
hates me. I can’t imagine why. I’ve met her on
the street. Nobody ever looked at me the way
she does.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink threw a quick glance over her
shoulder at Hugh, who came back from the
window, and stood near Millicent.</p>

<p>“This only came to light yesterday,” he said.
“Of course, if you are selling the place, it is all
right; but I talked with Grimshaw last night at
dinner, and I was not satisfied with his replies,
although he claimed to have your authority.
If there was anything for you to look into, I
thought it best for us to come in person; but, if
everything is being done by your order, there is
nothing for us to do but kiss you and leave you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” Millicent’s voice wavered, “I
suppose it would be dreadful to ask you to
change your mind, but Grandpa—I don’t know
what he will do. He loves every little sprout,
and—and there isn’t any other place—”</p>

<p>“Your grandfather seems to be your whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
thought,” said Miss Frink. She was definitely
frowning now, and her expression was severe.</p>

<p>“He is. I’d do anything—I’m doing something
almost disgraceful now in begging you—”
The voice stopped, and color came up in the
pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Hugh watched his aunt, but there was no
change in her expression.</p>

<p>“We thought if there was any question in your
mind,” he said, “that we would leave the car
here, and you would return with us on the train.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink looked at her watch. “The train
went while we were eating,” she said. “There
isn’t another until evening, but I think I will
go back with you. Meanwhile”—her set face
lightened—“I suggest that this girl lie down
and rest while you take me for a drive.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be bully!” agreed Hugh.</p>

<p>Millicent tried to control her trembling lips
as she followed Miss Frink’s movement and
rose. The latter went into the next room to put
on her hat.</p>

<p>Hugh took the young girl’s hands, and she
drew them away gently. “Don’t you see,” he
said softly, “that that is hopeful?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Oh, she looked so hard. I’m
afraid of her when she is the Queen of Farrandale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“But she wouldn’t go with us if it were settled.
You see that?”</p>

<p>“Then, why couldn’t she say one encouraging
word?”</p>

<p>“Because she doesn’t know how far Grimshaw
has gone. He said he had full authority.
Perhaps now she wishes she hadn’t given it to
him.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink came back. “Think how many
times you’ve put me to sleep, Millicent. Now
you let the ocean do the same for you. Go right
into that room and make yourself comfortable.
Lie down on my bed and don’t think about anything
but the waves.”</p>

<p>They left her, and Miss Frink looked at the
car admiringly as Hugh drove it around to
the hotel steps. It had been cleaned into new
blueness again, and she sank into the low seat
and breathed a sigh of satisfaction as it rolled
smoothly away.</p>

<p>“Poor Millicent,” said Hugh. He meant it
as a gentle hint that now they were alone his
aunt might confide in him on the affair that had
brought them. Evidently nothing was further
from her intention.</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope she gets to sleep,” she returned.
“Could anything run smoother than this,
Hugh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>The brisk ocean breeze swept past them.
Hugh accepted the dismissal of his little love.
He glanced around at his companion’s strong
features, set now in perfect contentment.</p>

<p>“I’m the lover she never had,” he reflected,
“and the husband she never had, and the son
she never had, and the grandson she thought
she had, but he comes right away and tells her
he loves somebody else. Tough, I’ll say.”</p>

<p>They were speeding along the road near the
sea, and passing summer homes set far apart.</p>

<p>“You will like to have the car in New York
this fall, Hugh.”</p>

<p>“It sure would be a big luxury.”</p>

<p>“You and Mr. Ogden would enjoy it—when
I wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>Miss Frink looked around at her chauffeur and
smiled, and he smiled back, valiantly, though he
was thinking that Millicent was probably not
asleep, but staring at the sea with dry, troubled
eyes.</p>

<p>“You will come, of course, Aunt Susanna, if I
go to law school there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I should cultivate quite an
intimacy with New York under those circumstances.
I’d bring her with me sometimes, too.”
Again she met Hugh’s eyes, and the sudden light
in them rewarded her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no other reference to Millicent
during the long drive, and they returned to find
the girl sitting on the porch. Her white face
pulled on Hugh’s heartstrings.</p>

<p>Miss Frink asked her if she had slept, and she
replied that she had had a fine rest; and she
asked interested questions about the drive until
Miss Frink went into the house to pack her
bag.</p>

<p>“Did she say anything more?” asked the girl
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nothing—except that when I am in New
York at the law school she will bring you to see
me.”</p>

<p>Millicent’s questioning expression faded. “I
shan’t be there to bring,” she said quietly; “we
shall have to move away into the country somewhere.”</p>

<p>“But that showed that she likes you, Millicent—that
all those absurd ideas about your
not satisfying her don’t amount to anything.
I told her. She knows what I want.”</p>

<p>“I understand better than you do.” Millicent
smiled faintly. “She knows you haven’t
met girls of your own kind yet, and what
changes a year may bring; but she wants to
keep you happy.”</p>

<p>They were able to get a chair car on the train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that night. Miss Frink and Hugh sat in adjoining
seats, and Millicent in the third leaned back
with closed eyes and thought of her grandfather,
and tried to make plans for their future. She
worked to exclude the radiant possibility which
had dawned on her in the wonderful ride of the
morning. Every joy she had ever dreamed of
was embraced in the thought of a life with Hugh;
but it was too sudden, he was too young to
know what he wanted, and she was sure that
Miss Frink’s plans and ambitions for him made
the idea of little Milly Duane an absurdity. The
Queen of Farrandale should see that her attitude
was completely shared by Millicent herself.</p>

<p>The train was late in starting, and, by reason
of detention along the way, it was after eleven
o’clock when it pulled into Farrandale. They
took a station taxicab and drove to Miss Frink’s
house, intending that, after the lady had entered,
Hugh, mindful of Colonel Duane’s exhortation,
would take Millicent home; but as they approached,
they were surprised to see the lower
floor of the house brightly lighted, and an automobile
parked before it.</p>

<p>“Come in with us, Millicent,” said Miss
Frink. “We may as well see what this illumination
means before you go home.”</p>

<p>Hugh let them into the hall with his latch-key,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and laughter from the end of the corridor
showed that the study was occupied. Miss
Frink led the way and was first to enter the
room. She stood for a moment while the gay
laughter died on the lips of her secretary and
Adèle Lumbard as they stared at the apparition.
Mr. Goldstein was standing by Miss Frink’s
flat-topped desk, and apparently had just laid
upon it a handful of gold pieces. Millicent
would have shrunk back, but Hugh held her
firmly by the arm and they followed Miss Frink
as she moved into the room.</p>

<p>Besides herself, Mr. Goldstein was the only
unembarrassed member of the company.</p>

<p>“In the nick of time, Miss Frink,” he said,
advancing with an air of cordial welcome. He
made a move toward shaking hands, but the
expression on the face of the Queen of Farrandale
discouraged him.</p>

<p>There succeeded a silent space while she
walked to the desk and picked up a paper bearing
her signature.</p>

<p>Her dark, bright gaze jumped to Grimshaw.</p>

<p>“I just wondered,” she said. The secretary
had grown very pale, and it was difficult to face
her; but he did so. Adèle stepped nearer to him.
“So you did use your power of attorney,” she
added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Grimshaw, with all the
dignity he could command. “As you know, I
am always looking out for advantageous business
moves for you. Here was one that was extraordinary.
The sale of that corner where the
Duanes have been living, to be used for an
apartment house, could only be made to a man
of Mr. Goldstein’s means—”</p>

<p>“And generosity.” Miss Frink’s interruption
was curt to fierceness. She grasped the gold
coins and let them jingle back on the desk.</p>

<p>The purchaser spoke cheerfully. “Oh, it was
all the same to me,” he said. “Mrs. Lumbard,
she is the lady that loves the gold.” He laughed
toward Adèle and wagged his head. “She likes
her salary in those good little solid pieces. Isn’t
it so, lovely lady?”</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s glance flashed at Adèle. “But
this is not her salary, I judge.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goldstein shrugged deprecatingly. “Oh,
no, Mr. Grimshaw has been very obliging.”</p>

<p>“Leonard, I feel that you had help in all this.”
The speaker regarded her secretary with deep
feeling. “You would not have done it, alone.”</p>

<p>Grimshaw could not speak; and Adèle saw it.
She cast a defiant, angry glance at Hugh and
Millicent, silent spectators of the scene. The girl’s
hands were unconsciously on her heart as hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
sprang in it for her grandfather’s deliverance.</p>

<p>“Miss Frink,” cried Adèle, “you have no
right to be speaking to Leonard as though he
were a criminal when he never thinks of anything
but your good. You were not here, and he
acted for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” said Mr. Goldstein, grave
now that he saw the transaction was displeasing,
“I certainly understood that everything
was correct. I have acted in good faith.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it,” returned Miss Frink.
“Gather up that gold, if you please. My employes
do not receive bribes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Goldstein mechanically obeyed, and his
troubled gaze rested on her.</p>

<p>“But I have paid good money down to clinch
this bargain,” he said.</p>

<p>Miss Frink’s genuine distress at her secretary’s
sordid action lightened at some thought.</p>

<p>She smiled at her young people, and Grimshaw
cast a baleful look at Hugh who had precipitated
this scene. Anxiety again clutched at
Millicent’s heart. Miss Frink had not been
mercenary. She had not ignored the love of
Colonel Duane for his simple, happy life, and
she was powerful. The girl studied her face now
for encouragement that, no matter how far matters
had gone, she could save them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“You should not withdraw from this, Miss
Frink,” said Grimshaw, inspired by a fiery look
from Adèle. “Indeed, it is not at all certain
that you can do so, legally.”</p>

<p>The lady’s smile faded. “You didn’t delve
into this matter quite far enough, Grim. Had
you happened to examine my deposit box, you
and I would both have been spared something.
Mr. Goldstein”—the speaker turned to the
would-be purchaser—“your money will be returned
to you. Mr. Grimshaw was unaware
that the Duane homestead does not belong to
me any longer. I learned rather recently that
some one dear to me had expressed admiration
for it, and the last thing I did before leaving
town was to transfer that property. I did not
speak of the transaction to any one: not even
to the new owner.”</p>

<p>The secretary’s spectacles regarded her, shining
in a very white face.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldstein returned to the charge. “Then
the property might still be for sale,” he said argumentatively.</p>

<p>“I think not,” returned Miss Frink. “I have
reason to believe that it will be held for—well,
it will not be regarded commercially. I am
sorry for your disappointment, Mr. Goldstein,
and I will bid you good-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-night, then, madam, and I shall hope
for a more fruitful meeting some day,” he returned.</p>

<p>Hugh and Millicent were blind to the exit of
the three, who moved quickly out of the room.</p>

<p>In that minute Hugh’s heart leaped, for the
Queen of Farrandale, who never did anything
by halves, drew Millicent away from him and,
passing an arm around her, held her close. The
girl flushed with pleasure in the loving caress,
for the bright old eyes that met hers were
blurred.</p>

<p>“Come here, Hugh.” Her free hand drew
him. “He is your landlord now, Millicent. I
hope he will be a good one.”</p>

<p>The boy threw his arms around the pair, and
held them. “I don’t know what to do with you,
Aunt Susanna,” he said unsteadily.</p>

<p>“Why, of course, I had to give you an engagement
present,” she returned.</p>

<p>The surprise and relief of the moment seemed
to center in the radiant young creature whose
rosy cheek Miss Frink’s lips were pressing.</p>

<p>“Millicent!” cried the lover softly, and there
was a wealth of joy present, and joy to come, in
the exclamation. “Millicent!”</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
